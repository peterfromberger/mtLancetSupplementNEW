(2021). [@frombergerMyTabuAPlaceboControlled2021]\n\n### Structure of WBI\n\nThe WBI \\@myTabu consists of three isolated sections, one only for participants, one only for the online coaches, and one section for community supervisors (see @fig-sitemap). The access to these sections was secured by username and password full-filling the criteria of the DSGVO. On the landing page of the coach section, a dashboard informs the coach on tasks he has to perform (e.g. unanswered messages by a client, open guided tasks). Each coach had only access to the participants he was responsible for. The landing page links to the in-app messenger and a page for working on guided tasks together with the participant.\nThe supervisor section, only accessible by participating community supervisors, provides a landing page which summarized important key aspects (treatment progress, critical events) of all participants, which have been supervised by this supervisor. Due to security reasons, the supervisor was able to see the raw values of the primary endpoint. If a item of the primary endpoint has been graded as a potential hint to recidivism by lawyers within the research team during development of the app, additional judicial information are provided specifically for the federal state the supervision officer is working at.\n\n![Sitemap of the WBI \\@myTabu. WBI = Web-Based Intervention. ](_diagrams/mtDiagrams-Sitemap.png){#fig-sitemap width=100%}\n\nThe participant section, only accessible by participants, provides on the landing page key aspects of their progress, e.g. current saldo, gudied exercises the have to work on, a help page, a first aid kit as well as a section for the WBI. The participants are remembered on open guided tasks or being late with the intervention by in-app alerts. The WBI starts with two introductory sessions, in order to explain the participants how the app works. After finishing the instruction section, the participants is linked to the first lection of the WBI. The structure and organization of the content was identical across both trial arms. The WBI was structured into six modules, each module into four sessions and each session into six to eight lections. A lection was divided into different content blocks: guided exercises, psychoeducation, examples (virtual participants), and automated exercises. Virtual participants accompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor)At the beginning of each session, key elements from the previous session or module were recapped. At the end of each session, the most important points of that session or module were summarized. Content created during exercises was partly dynamic integrated in consecutive sessions. For example, at the start of the intervention participants created a list of positive activities, which was later used to suggest ways in which they could reward themselves for completing a session or module. In both trial arms, the program included digital psycho-educational blocks incorporating multimedia elements such as videos and graphics, as well as guided and unguided exercises. A total of eighteen different online exercises (e.g., fill‑in‑the‑gap tasks, multiple‑choice questions, four-field-tasks) were integrated into the WBI. These exercises were either offered as self‑guided tasks with automated feedback or as coach‑guided tasks in which feedback was provided by online coaches. In the intervention arm, the most relevant aspects of each session were delivered as guided tasks. In the placebo arm, the allocation of tasks as guided or unguided was determined based on a predefined matching procedure to replicate the distribution of guided and unguided tasks in the intervention arm. The feedback of the online coaches was manualized: Within a special section of the WBI, the coach was able to choose pre-build templates for each guided task (see @fig-act-guided-task). Furthermore, an in-app messaging system allowed the user to communicate with the online coach as well as the supervision officer in a secured environment. It was ensured that messages and feedback for guided tasks has been provided within 36 hours by the coach. In order to enhance the extrinsic motivation of participants, an automatic reward system is integrated based on a gamification approach. That is, participants receive coins and virtual awards for each finished content block. The coins can be changed into Euros, if the participant has collected at least 15 Euros, he can request the payout online. The participant can receive a maximum compensation of 120 Euro. Finally, an online first aid kit was provided for each user and filled with individual skills prepared by the user itself during guided tasks in the intervention arm. In the placebo arm, the first add kit was not individualized but pre-filled with basic hints. Throughout all modules, the speech was friendly, empathetic, simple, and easy to understand (e.g., no technical terms, examples of everyday life) in order to account for the different cognitive functioning level of participants.\n\n![Process flow of guided exercises. 29 guided exercises have been developed for each trial arm. The figure shows the process of reviewing a guided task by study therapists.](_diagrams/mtDiagrams-act_Guided_Task.png){#fig-act-guided-task width=100%}\n\n### Theoretical foundation\n\nAlready established therapeutic concepts from in-face community-based treatment programs for individuals who committed sexual offenses against children [@brikenPraeventionSexuellenKindesmissbrauchs2017; @wildPreventionSexualChild2020] as well as cognitive-behavioral treatment concepts build the theoretical ground of the WBI; see @frombergerMyTabuAPlaceboControlled2021 for more details. The in-person programs have been adapted for online use. Both programs have been designed for CSA as well as CSEM offenders. Parts relevant to the meaningful risk factors of both in-face programs have been digitalized and parts on risk factors not supported by empirical evidence have been skipped in order to shorten the WBI. The content of the intervention arm focused exclusively on psychological meaningful risk factors [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023], see @fig-wbi-overview for an overview of the theoretical concept of the WBI. To achieve a reduction in re-offenses, it seems to be most promising to target dynamic factors, which are changeable and strong associated with recidivism [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023]. Mann et al. (2010) introduced the term meaningful psychological risk factors for sexual offending by identifying those risk factors in the literature, which are dynamic and therefore changeable by treatment and are empirically proved in enhancing the risk for recidivism. Recently, Seto et al. (2023) replicated the findings and proofed the meaningful risk factors with a broader and more recent literature basis. The emprirical basis for risk factors for CSAM-exclusive offences is not as broad as for sexual offending in the sense of in-person offences. @babchishinChildSexualExploitation2018 elaborated in their review risk factors for CSEM-exclusive offenders. Atypical sexual interests, sexual pre-occupation, sexual arousal, access to the internet and children, and distorted cognitions are assumed to play a key role in recidivism. Thus, there is a overlap between risk factors for CSA offenses and risk factors for CSAM offenses [@reichelReviewRiskFactors2024]. But it is assumed, that e.g. the content of offense-supportive attitudes differs from the content of offense-supportive attitudes for mixed offenders or CSA-exclusive offenders. Access to children or the internet is a so-called facilitating factor in the sense of the Motivation-Facilitation Model of sexual offending and therefore only indirect changeable by treatment [@setoMotivationFacilitationModelSexual2019]. In consequence, addressed risk factore were the same for participants with CSA offences and participants with CSEM offences. Virtual participants (four male and one female offender with different offense histories) accompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor). Guided exercises are used at the core of cognitive-behavioral treatment within the WBI. Guided exercises have been developed to train important new concepts online. They ensure, that the participants have to think about the previous contents to answer them correctly, since the online coach reviews the answers. Additionally, guided exercises are the most probable content block in which the online coach gets in touch with the participant (see @fig-act-guided-task). All modules within the intervention arm comprised techniques of motivational interviewing [@rollnickMotivationalInterviewingTreatment2015] to enhance or maintain the motivation of the participants. The WBI is designed for female as well as male participants, but due to a lack of knowledge with regard to specific risk factors for female sex offenders at development of the WBI, the content remains identical for women and men. In order to make the WBI suitable for female participants, the used language was adapted and one female virtual participant has been designed and integrated. The placebo arm was developed to ensure the same mode, dose, and amount of support and attention by supporting online coaches as in the intervention arm - but the content of the modules was unrelated to meaningful dynamic risk factors. The content of the placebo condition comprised information on healthy living, e.g., healthy nutrition, physical activities, or healthy sleep. The amount of guided exercises was the same as in the intervention arm (n = 29 guided exercises), but the exercises have been specifically designed to not induce any sustainable effect. In the following paragraphs, the theoretical backgorund of each module is described in detail.\n\n![Overview of the WBI.

[@wardMultifactorOffenderReadiness2004] Empirical evidence indicates that higher treatment motivation is associated with greater therapeutic success among individuals who committed CSA offences and with programme dropout in web‑based interventions for alcohol use disorder. [@terryMotivationSexOffender2001; @postelEffectivenessWebbasedIntervention2010] Reviews of web‑based interventions suggest that most treatment discontinuation occurs before the active treatment phase begins and that the timing of dropout is comparable between in‑person and therapist‑guided web‑based treatments. [@melvilleDropoutInternetbasedTreatment2010] As motivation to change is likely to influence treatment engagement, outcomes, and dropout among ICCO, these findings highlight the importance of addressing motivation at the outset of the study. [@terryMotivationSexOffender2001; @postelEffectivenessWebbasedIntervention2010] The motivation module is therefore grounded in motivational interviewing principles, which conceptualise behavioural change as a process marked by ambivalence. [@rollnickMotivationalInterviewingTreatment2015] Therapists support participants in exploring reasons for and against change, with a focus on personal values and goal setting to foster intrinsic motivation. The approach is guided by four core principles—expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, avoiding argumentation, and supporting self‑efficacy—implemented through open‑ended questioning, reflective listening, affirmations, change‑talk strategies, resistance management, confidence‑building techniques, and summaries.\n\n#### Module 2: Supervision and social relationships\n\nTheoretical and empirical models of criminal behaviour underscore the relevance of social influences for recidivism. [@andrewsPsychologyCriminalConduct2010] Negative social environments and resistance to rules and supervision have been identified as meaningful risk factors for sexual reoffending. [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023; @hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004] Accordingly, interventions for ICCO under CS should promote the development of protective social networks. Such networks extend beyond family and peers to include therapists, supervision officers, and social workers. The supervision and social relationships module of \\@myTabu therefore aims to strengthen motivation to establish positive social connections and to reduce resistance to supervision through psychoeducational and cognitive‑behavioural techniques, including the illustration of associations between negative social networks and reoffending and the provision of strategies to disengage from criminogenic influences. A further established risk factor for sexual reoffending is the absence of emotionally intimate adult relationships. [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] Individuals who have committed sexual offences and maintain stable adult partnerships show lower recidivism rates than those who do not, and deficits in emotionally intimate adult relationships are linearly associated with sexual reoffending. [@hansonAssessingRiskSexual2007; @hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004] Consequently, this module provides information on these associations and offers guidance to support the development of emotionally intimate adult relationships. To date, the effectiveness of the specific supervision‑related content described here has not been empirically evaluated, either in in‑person or in web‑based interventions.\n\n#### Module 3: Emotion management\n\nLifestyle impulsiveness as a pattern characterised by low self‑control, instability in employment and housing, absence of meaningful daily routines, irresponsible decision‑making, and limited or unrealistic long‑term goals is associated with recdivism. Lifestyle impulsiveness is a well‑established risk factor for sexual reoffending with a broad empirical base. [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] For dysfunctional coping, Knight and Thornton demonstrated that external coping—defined as a tendency to respond to stressful and negatively valenced emotional events in a reckless and impulsive manner—predicts sexual recidivism. [@knightEvaluatingImprovingRisk2007] To address these risk factors, \\@myTabu integrates skills training derived from Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT [@linehanCourseEvolutionDialectical2015]) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT [@hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy1999]) with the aim of reducing impulsivity and strengthening coping capacities in response to stressful or negatively experienced life events. DBT skills training targets emotion regulation and distress tolerance by teaching alternative behavioural strategies to replace external or sexualised coping. DBT has previously been shown to reduce impulsive behaviour in forensic populations, and web‑based interventions based on DBT principles have demonstrated effectiveness, particularly in reducing stress, across several psychiatric conditions. [@berzinsDevelopmentImplementationDialectical2004; @spijkermanEffectivenessOnlineMindfulnessbased2016; @jayawardeneEffectsPreventiveOnline2016] ACT focuses on fostering a meaningful life by promoting acceptance of negative internal experiences and providing strategies for adaptive responses to emotional distress. [@hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy1999] ACT has been successfully applied in offender treatment settings and has shown promising results when delivered via web‑based interventions for various psychiatric disorders. [@spijkermanEffectivenessOnlineMindfulnessbased2016; @jayawardeneEffectsPreventiveOnline2016; @lanzaAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy2014]\n\n#### Module 4: Problem solving\nMeta‑analyses have demonstrated a significant association between poor social problem‑solving abilities and sexual recidivism. [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] Social problem solving is defined as a self‑directed cognitive‑behavioural process through which individuals attempt to identify and implement effective solutions to problems encountered in everyday life. [@dzurillaSocialProblemSolving2004] Within the widely accepted cognitive model proposed by D’Zurilla and Goldfried, problem solving comprises two dimensions: problem orientation and problem‑solving style. Problem orientation may be positive (PPO) or negative (NPO). PPO is associated with adaptive coping and reduced emotional distress, whereas NPO is linked to avoidance and ineffective coping strategies. [@dzurillaProblemSolvingBehavior1971]\nAccording to this model, three problem‑solving styles can be distinguished: rational problem solving (RPS), impulsive coping style (ICS), and avoidance style (AS). RPS involves a systematic and planned application of skills to achieve adaptive solutions. In contrast, ICS is characterised by unsystematic responses, often involving the implementation of the first available option, while AS is marked by avoidance of problems and reliance on external solutions.\nEmpirical evidence indicates that ICCO exhibit higher levels of NPO and lower levels of PPO than the general population and show a greater tendency towards ICS and AS compared with RPS. [@nezuProblemSolvingTherapyTreatment2013] Moreover, poor problem‑solving skills in this population have been shown to be amenable to change through psychological interventions. [@wakelingPsychometricValidationSocial2007; @mcguireReviewEffectiveInterventions2008] The problem‑solving module therefore aims to improve deficient problem‑solving skills by drawing on the well‑established principles of Problem‑Solving Therapy (PST [@nezuProblemSolvingTherapyTreatment2013]). The module focuses on fostering a positive problem orientation and strengthening rational problem‑solving skills.\n\n#### Module 5: Offense‑supportive cognitions\nOffense‑supportive attitudes among ICCO can be summarised as beliefs that children are capable of sexually mature relationships, are not harmed by sexual contact with adults, or actively provoke sexual behaviour in adults. [@mannTreatingCognitiveComponents2016; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] These attitudes must be clearly distinguished from attempts to excuse or justify one’s own specific offences, which should not be the focus of cognitive treatment. [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010] A meta‑analysis by Helmus et al. demonstrated that only offense‑supportive attitudes, as defined above, constitute a psychologically meaningful risk factor in terms of predicting sexual recidivism among ICCO. [@helmusAttitudesSupportiveSexual2013] In contrast, offence‑specific justifications have not been shown to be predictive and are therefore not considered primary targets of intervention. The offense‑supportive attitudes module applies cognitive restructuring to modify offense‑supportive beliefs. Cognitive restructuring is the most widely used and best‑evaluated technique for changing maladaptive cognitions in this population. Modifying implicit theories, attitudes, and beliefs is challenging, particularly among ICCO, as such beliefs may not be experienced as harmful by the individual and may instead serve to minimise perceived harm resulting from their own offences. [@mannTreatingCognitiveComponents2016] Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated that cognitive restructuring can effectively reduce implicit offense‑supportive beliefs and attitudes. [@beechAssessmentTreatmentDistorted2013]\n\n#### Module 6: Sexuality\n\nIndividuals who have committed sexual offences have been shown to be more sexually active and more strongly interested in sexual topics than non‑offending individuals. [@lalumiereTestMateDeprivation1996] Sexual preoccupation is characterised by intrusive sexual thoughts and behaviours that are difficult or impossible to control (84) and has been shown to be strongly associated with sexual reoffending. [@hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004] Accordingly, a primary aim of the sexuality module is to provide basic knowledge about sexuality and to support the reduction of excessive sexual thoughts and behaviours. The module further aims to increase awareness of high‑risk situations that may trigger sexual thoughts and behaviours. Participants are provided with strategies to manage and, where possible, reduce sexual preoccupation by limiting sexual thoughts and activities. Emotional congruence with children represents another central risk factor addressed in the sexuality module. ICCO under CS may experience a perceived emotional closeness to children and, when identifying themselves with children, may find it easier to initiate contact with them. [@matthesDeutscheVersionStable20072008] Emotional congruence with children is therefore considered a risk factor strongly associated with sexual reoffending. [@wardIntegratedTheorySexual2006] The sexuality module seeks to reduce emotional congruence with children through psychoeducational approaches, emphasising that emotionally equal relationships between adults and children are not possible and providing strategies to establish greater emotional distance from children.\nSexual interest in children, including sexual fantasies involving children, constitutes one of the most important risk factors for sexual reoffending among ICCO [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] and has been described as a potential motivational factor underlying sexual abuse of children. [@wardDynamicRiskFactors2016] Reducing sexual interest in children while strengthening non‑deviant sexual interests may therefore contribute to risk reduction. The extent to which sexual interests can change across the lifespan remains debated, and empirical evidence is currently insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. [@olverEvaluatingChangeMen2020] Clinically, both changes in sexual interests and highly persistent pedophilic interests have been observed, supporting the conceptualisation of sexual interest in children as a dynamic risk factor that may change over time. [@olverEvaluatingChangeMen2020] Within the sexuality module, cognitive‑behavioural techniques are applied to influence sexual interest in and, where possible, sexual fantasies about children, while promoting sexual interest in adults. The techniques employed in this module have demonstrated effectiveness in in‑person treatments and, at least among younger individuals, have also been applied in web‑based interventions.

Information from the court files are coded by the study investigators to determine whether the participant meets the study inclusion criteria. This includes information e.g on the index offense, and former offenses. In case that items of the SSQ-CF cannot be filled out adequately by utilizing court files, the participants was interviewed directly.\n\n#### PHQ-D\nThe Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-D [@loeweGesundheitsfragebogenFuerPatienten2002]) is a screening tool for mental disorders. Classification of results generally takes place on a syndrome level. Syndromes examined are: Somatoform disorders, major depressive syndrome, other depressive syndrome, panic syndrome, other anxiety syndromes, eating disorder syndrome, alcohol abuse. Tests are scored using a stencil. Utilizing a sum score for each syndrome, conclusions pertaining to the severity of each syndrome can be drawn. The measure shows good to very good diagnostic validity, especially regarding panic disorder and major depression [@graefeScreeningPsychischerStoerungen2004].\n\n#### SSPI-2\nThe Revised Scale for Pedophilic Interests (SSPI-2 [@setoRevisedScreeningScale2017a]) is a structured rating scale of assessing pedophilic interests based on the offending behavior. It comprises five items (number, age, gender, relationship of victims, and child pornography) and is significantly associated with phallometrically assessed sexual arousal to children. The SSPI-2 is derived from information of the participants as well as the supervision officer and is only defined for hands-on offenders [@setoRevisedScreeningScale2017a].\n\n#### ICD-11-Screener\nThe ICD-11-Screener [@screenerInstituteSexResearch2019] is a self-assessment procedure to ascertain indications for the presence of sexual dysfunction, gender dysphoria, or paraphilic disorder. However, the instrument is not suitable for diagnosis. It is assumed that the ICD-11-Screener can identify individuals who have the disorders described above. The ICD-11-Screener is not validated yet. Due to a mistake by the PI, this questionnaire was not mentioned in the SAP.\n\n#### CARES\nThe Child Sexual Abuse Risk Evaluation Self-Report (CARES) is a composite instrument integrating the CARES-A, which assesses acute dynamic risk factors, and the CARES-S, which measures stable dynamic risk factors. [@sonjaetzlerDevelopmentInitialValidationsubmitted] The CARES total score is calculated by summing the CARES-A and CARES-S total scores, producing a range from 0 to 102, with higher scores indicating greater severity of both acute and stable dynamic risk factors. The CARES-A scale evaluates seven acute dynamic risk factors associated with sexual reoffending in individuals convicted of at least one (contact or non-contact) sexual offense against children: (1) Preoccupation with Potential Victims, (2) Hostility, (3) Hypersexuality, (4) Rejection of Control Measures, (5) Emotional Crisis, (6) Loss of Social Support, and (7) Substance Use. Comprising 21 items, the CARES-A yields scores from 0 to 42; higher scores denote more pronounced acute dynamic risk. Reliability coefficients for the CARES-A range from $\\alpha$ = .79 to $\\alpha$ = .83. Analyses of social desirability revealed no significant correlations between CARES-A scores and either the exaggeration of positive qualities or negative qualities. [@sonjaetzlerDevelopmentInitialValidationsubmitted] The CARES-S scale assesses six stable dynamic predictors of sexual recidivism. It consists of 30 items covering: (1) Problematic Sexual Interests, (2) Problematic Emotion-Regulation, (3) Lack of Problem-Solving Skills, (4) Offense-Supportive Cognitions, and (5) Lack of Social Support. Five of these subscales correspond to empirically supported psychological risk factors for sexual recidivism [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023]. The CARES-S total score ranges from 0 to 60; higher scores indicate stronger stable dynamic risk factors. The reduced CARES-S achieved an internal consistency of $\\alpha$ = .53. As with the CARES-A, no significant correlations with social desirability measures were found in the evaluation study.  [@sonjaetzlerDevelopmentInitialValidationsubmitted]\n\n#### Official re-offences\nOfficially registered re-offenses will be assessed five years after last-patient-out (September 2030).\n\n#### CVTRQ\nThe Corrections Victoria Treatment Readiness Questionnaire (CVTRQ [@caseyAssessingSuitabilityOffender2007]) is a self-report measure designed to assess treatment readiness in offenders who have been referred to a cognitive skills program. It comprises 20 items and consists of four scales: (1) Attitudes and motivation, (2) emotional reaction, (3) offending beliefs, and (4) efficacy. Each item has to be answered on a five-point Likert-scale. The CVTRQ shows an acceptable convergent validity, discriminant validity as well as predictive validity [@caseyAssessingSuitabilityOffender2007]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no validated German version of the CVTRQ. \\@myTabu translated the CVTRQ. The translation was checked and translated back into English. Resulting differences due to adaptation were inspected and discussed in terms of item content.\n\n#### RCQ\nThe Readiness to Change Questionnaire (RCQ [@rollnickDevelopmentShortReadiness1992]) is a 12 item questionnaire originally designed to identify the stage of change reached by individuals who excessively drink alcohol. The German version (RCQ-D)[@hannoverReadinessChangeQuestionnaire2002] was adapted within the project by changing the questions regarding drinking of alcohol in questions regarding CSA and CSEM offenses. Responses are made on a five-point Likert-scale. The RCQ-D as well as the RCQ shows good psychometric properties. [@hannoverReadinessChangeQuestionnaire2002] Psychometric properties of the version adapted for ISAC and ICCSEM are not available yet.\n\n#### OQMPR\nThe Questionnaire for the Measurement of Psychological Reactance (QMPR [@merzQuestionnaireMeasurementPsychological1983]) is a questionnaire for the assessment of psychological reactance defined as the theory that people resist attempts to constrain either their thoughts or their behaviors. The Optimized Questionnaire for the Measurement of Psychological Reactance (OQMPR)[@herzbergZurPsychometrischenOptimierung2002] is a German variant of the QMPR. The OQMPR consists of 12 statements on a five-point Likert-scale. It has a test-retest-reliability of rtt = 0.85. [@herzbergZurPsychometrischenOptimierung2002]\n\n#### F-SozU\nSeven-item short version of the Social Support Questionnaire (F-SozU [@dunkelEvaluationShortformSocial2005]) is an efficient questionnaire to assess perceived social support. Each item comprises a five-point Likertscale. Internal consistency of the original long version showed Cronbach's $\\alpha$ between 0.81 and 0.93. [@fydrichFragebogenZurSozialen]\n\n#### UCLA\nThe UCLA Loneliness Scale (UCLA [@russellUCLALonelinessScale1996]) consists of 20 items in order to assess subjective feelings of loneliness. The German short version [@doringPsychometrischeEinsamkeitsforschungDeutsche1993] consists of 12 items on a four-point Likert-scale. A German study with CSA and CSEM offenders demonstrated a high reliability of $\\alpha$ = 0.92. [@neutzeUndetectedDetectedChild2012]\n\n#### DERS\nThe Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS [@gratzMultidimensionalAssessmentEmotion2004]) is a self-report questionnaire to assess emotion dysregulation. The sub-scale \"impulse control difficulties\" is used as outcome measure and comprises five items on a five-point Likert-scale. The German version is used, which shows a good internal consistency, construct and predictive validity. [@ehringCharacteristicsEmotionRegulation2008]\n\n#### NARQ\nThe Negative Affect Repair Questionnaire (NARQ [@schererNegativeAffectRepair2013]) is a self-report questionnaire to assess strategies to regulate negative affect in a systematic manner. It consists of 17 items on a five-point Likert-scale and provides a good construct validity. Reliability scores (Cronbach's $\\alpha$) for the three NARQ scales ranged between 0.71 and 0.80. [@schererNegativeAffectRepair2013]\n\n#### BIS-15\nThe Barratt Impulsiveness Scale-15 (BIS-15 [@pattonFactorStructureBarratt1995]) is a questionnaire developed to assess the personality/behavioral construct of impulsiveness. It consists of 30 items on a four-point Likert-scale. The German short version BIS-15 [@meulePsychometrischeEvaluationDeutschen2011] consisting of 15 items is used in the clinical trial. The BIS-15 is an efficient measure of impulsiveness with good internal consistency of $\\alpha$ = 0.81.  [@meulePsychometrischeEvaluationDeutschen2011]\n\n#### CUSI\nThe Coping Using Sex Inventory (CUSI [@cortoniSexCopingStrategy2001]) is a questionnaire to assess the presence of and the degree to which sex was used to deal with problematic situations. It consists of 16 items on a fivepoint Likert-scale with a satisfying internal consistency. [@cortoniSexCopingStrategy2001] The translation was checked and translated back into English by the authors. Resulting differences due to adaptation were inspected and discussed in terms of item content.\n\n#### SPSI-R\nThe Social Problem-Solving Inventory Revised (SPSI-R [@dzurillaSocialProblemSolving2004]) is a self-report questionnaire for the assessment of the five dimensions in the social problem-solving model: (1) positive problem orientation, (2) negative problem orientation, (3) rational problem solving, (4) impulsivity/carelessness style, and (5) avoidance style. The SPSI-R consists of 52 items on a five-point Likert-scale. It shows good psychometric properties for individuals who have sexually offended [@wakelingPsychometricValidationSocial2007]. The validated German version is a short form consisting of 25 items [@grafPsychometrischeUeberpruefungDeutschsprachigen2003].\n\n#### BMS\nThe Bumby Molest Scale (BMS [@bumbyAssessingCognitiveDistortions]) is a self-report questionnaire which assesses offense supportive cognitions of CSA or CSEM offenders (German Version: [@feelgoodKVMSkalaZurErfassung2009]). It consists of 38 items on a four-point Likert-scale. The German version shows good construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability [@feelgoodKVMSkalaZurErfassung2009].\n\n#### HBI-19\nSexual preoccupation is assessed by the Hypersexual Behavior Inventory-19 (HBI-19 [@kleinValidierungsstudieDeutschenVersion2013]). The HBI-19 is a three-factor measure (coping, control, and consequences) developed to assess hypersexual behavior. The instrument consists of 19 items (e.g., 'I use sex to forget sorrows of everyday life.') answered on a scale from 1 (never) to 5 (very often). The maximum score is 95, with higher scores indicating a higher level of sexual preoccupation. The questionnaire was shown to have good reliability ($\\alpha$ = 0.90) and validity. [@kleinValidierungsstudieDeutschenVersion2013]\n\n#### SSIC\nThe Specific self-efficacy for modifying Sexual Interest in Children (SSIC [@tozdanSpezifischeSelbstwirksamkeitZur2015]) comprises six items on the participant's conviction regarding the ability to change their sexual interest in children (e.g., 'I can succeed in reducing my sexual interest in children') were answered on a scale from 1 (do not agree at all) to 5 (totally agree). The maximum score is 30, with higher scores indicating a higher level of self-efficacy. The instrument was shown to have good reliability ($\\alpha$ = 0.87) and validity [@tozdanSpezifischeSelbstwirksamkeitZur2015].\n\n#### SOI-R\nThe Item 2a of the Sexual Outlet Inventory revised (SOI-R [@brikenSexualOutletInventory2010]) assesses the desire for sexual activity involving children on a visual analog scale from 0 (desire is absent) to 100 (\"I have to act to satisfy the desire)\"\". Higher values on the scale indicate a stronger sexual interest in children. [@brikenSexualOutletInventory2010]\n\n#### EKK-R\nEmotional congruence with children is assessed by the Questionnaire on Emotional Congruence with Children-Revised (EKK-R [@mackEmotionaleKongruenzMit2012]) including three factors (special relationship to children, immaturity, and emotional closeness to children). Twenty items are answered on a four-point scale. The questionnaire demonstrated good reliability ($\\alpha$ = 0.80) and validity. [@mackEmotionaleKongruenzMit2012]\n\n#### ESIQ\nThe Explicit Sexual Interest Questionnaire (ESIQ [@banseIndirectMeasuresSexual2010]) directly assesses pedophilic interest. It consists of two scales measuring sexual behavior (20 items, e.g., 'I enjoyed orally stimulating a man.') and sexual fantasies (20 items, e.g., 'I find it attractive to imagine a little boy sexually stimulating me.'). All items are answered on a scale from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The reliability of the instrument ranges between 0.86 and 0.97 [@banseIndirectMeasuresSexual2010].\n\n#### WHO-5\nThe WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5 [@bechMeasuringDimensionPsychological2004]) is a questionnaire that measures current mental well-being with five items. The items are rated on a six-point Likert-scale ranging from 0 (at no time) to 5 (all of the time). The WHO-5 has shown good validity in measuring subjective well-being in clinical studies [@toppWHO5WellbeingIndex2015]. The norm in Germany is mean 65.7. The threshold for a clinically relevant change is defined as a change of at least 10 points on the total score. [@toppWHO5WellbeingIndex2015] Due to a mistake by the PI, this questionnaire was not mentioned in the SAP.\n\n#### QNP\nThe Questionnaire of Non-Participation (QNP) was developed to assess reasons for not taking part in the study. It comprises eleven items on a six-point Likert-scale. Items are e.g., 'I will not take part in the study because I do not need any further help.' or 'I will not take part in the study because I am afraid of negative consequences if my SO gets additional information about me.' The QNP will only be administered if a potential participant will not take part in the study but has given informed consent to fill out this questionnaire. Due to a mistake by the PI, this questionnaire was not mentioned in the SAP.\n\n#### MRQ\nThe Mood and Risk Questionnaire (MRQ) consists of ten self-developed items, of which six are asking about thoughts and behaviors associated with potential re-offenses and four asking about the psychological and emotional state of the participant. The MRQ was developed by the \\@myTabu team in order to assess adverse events in a structured manner and with adapted adverse events for individuals who have a history of CSA or CSEM. The MRQ has been assessed before and after each session of the WBI and differs between the items in the pre and post measurements: all items of the pre measurement refer explicitly to the time between finishing last post measurement and before starting the new session (time not working on the WBI). The post measurement explicitly asks for the time during working on the session. The MRQ has the following one-item subscales: (1)  Contact planning (\"...have you thought about how to best make contact with a child?\");  (2) Contact preparation (\"...have you made preparations to be able to make contact with a child?\"); (3) Urge for CSA (\"...have you felt that you must commit a sexual act with a child?\"); (4) Urge for CSEM (\"...have you felt that you might soon (again) watch child sexual abuse material?\"); (5) Sexual tension (\"...have you felt that sexual tension has built up within you?)\"; (6) Control of sexual thoughts and activity (\"...have you felt that it is difficult for you to control your sexual thoughts and activities?\"); (7) Unable to cope with the mental burden (\"...have you felt that you can no longer endure burdens?\"); (8) Suicidal ideations (\"...have you thought about taking your own life?\"); (9) Mental crisis (\"At present, I feel that my behavior and experience are impaired due to mental problems.\"); (10) Very bad negative mood (\"How do you feel at the moment?\"). An adverse event was defined as the highest possible score on each one-item self-report subscale ('Often' for subscales 1–8, 'Strongly agree' for subscale 9, and 'Very bad' for subscale 10). The MRQ post questionnaire explicitly asks for the time during working on the WBI, whereas the MRQ pre questionnaire eclusiviely asks for the last week before measurement timepoint. Please note, that the occurence of a report of the highest possible score was defined as adverse event post-hoc. Due to a mistake by the PI, this questionnaire was not mentioned in the SAP.\n\n#### WAI-SR\nThe Working Alliance Inventory-Short Revised (WAI-SR [@wilmersDeutschsprachigeVersionWorking2008; @horvathDevelopmentWorkingAlliance1986]) measures three dimensions of therapeutic alliance: (a) bond, (b) task, and (c) goal. For the purpose of this study, the original items of the German version [@wilmersDeutschsprachigeVersionWorking2008] were adapted to be suitable for a web-based intervention. The items have to be rated on a five-point Likertscale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). It was adapted to suit to the online-coach (WAI-SR COACH) as well as the supervision officer (WAI-SR SUPERVISOR) resulting in 16 items. Internal consistency (Cronbach's $\\alpha$) of the original questionnaire ranges from 0.82 to 0.90 [@wilmersDeutschsprachigeVersionWorking2008]. Due to a mistake by the PI, this questionnaire was not mentioned in the SAP.\n\n#### EQ\nThe Exclusion Questionnaire (EQ) is a questionnaire to assess the exclusion reasons of the supervision officer. The EQ was specifically developed for this clinical trial by the project team. Only supervision officers were able to exclude a participant from the trial by clicking a button in the WBI. After clicking the button, the supervision officer had to fill in the EQ before the PI was informed to exclude the participant by Email. The EQ asks about eight possible exclusion reasons (e.g. re-offences, withdraw of informed consent) and one additional free text from. Multiple answers on the eight exclusion reasons are possible. Due to a mistake by the PI, this questionnaire was not mentioned in the SAP.\n\n\n::: {.landscape}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-measurement-timepoints .cell tbl-cap='Measurement timepoints for all trial endpoints. Please note, that the Mood and Risk Questionnaire (MRQ) is not listed in the table. The MRQ Pre was assessed before each session, the MRQ Post after each session.
