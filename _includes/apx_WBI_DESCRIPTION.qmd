The HBI \@myTabu consists of three isolated sections, one only for participants, one only for the online coaches, and one section for community supervisors (see @fig-sitemap). The access to these sections was secured by username and password full-filling the criteria of the DSGVO. On the landing page of the coach section, a dashboard informs the coach on tasks he has to perform (e.g. unanswered messages by a client, open guided tasks). Each coach had only access to the participants he was responsible for. The landing page links to the in-app messenger and a page for working on guided tasks together with the participant.

The supervisor section, only accessible by participating community supervisors, provides a landing page which summarized important key aspects (treatment progress, critical events) of all participants, which have been supervised by this supervisor. Due to security reasons, the supervisor was able to see the raw values of the primary endpoint. If a item of the primary endpoint has been graded as a potential hint to recidivism by lawyers within the research team during development of the app, additional judicial information are provided specifically for the federal state the supervision officer is working at.

The participant section, only accessible by participants, provides on the landing page key aspects of their progress, e.g. current saldo, gudied exercises the have to work on, a help page, a first aid kit as well as a section for the WBI. The participants are remembered on open guided tasks or being late with the intervention by in-app alerts. The WBI starts with two introductory sessions, in order to explain the participants how the app works. After finishing the instruction section, the participants is linked to the first lection of the WBI. The structure and organization of the content was identical across both trial arms. The WBI was structured into six modules, each module into four sessions and each session into six to eight lections. A lection was divided into different content blocks: guided exercises, psychoeducation, examples (virtual participants), and automated exercises (see @fig-act-lection). Virtual participants accompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor)At the beginning of each session, key elements from the previous session or module were recapped. At the end of each session, the most important points of that session or module were summarized. Content created during exercises was partly dynamic integrated in consecutive sessions. For example, at the start of the intervention participants created a list of positive activities, which was later used to suggest ways in which they could reward themselves for completing a session or module. In both trial arms, the program included digital psycho-educational blocks incorporating multimedia elements such as videos and graphics, as well as guided and unguided exercises. A total of eighteen different online exercises (e.g., fill‑in‑the‑gap tasks, multiple‑choice questions, four-field-tasks) were integrated into the WBI. These exercises were either offered as self‑guided tasks with automated feedback or as coach‑guided tasks in which feedback was provided by online coaches. In the intervention arm, the most relevant aspects of each session were delivered as guided tasks. In the placebo arm, the allocation of tasks as guided or unguided was determined based on a predefined matching procedure to replicate the distribution of guided and unguided tasks in the intervention arm. The feedback of the online coaches was manualized: Within a special section of the WBI, the coach was able to choose pre-build templates for each guided task (see @fig-act-guided-task). Furthermore, an in-app messaging system allowed the user to communicate with the online coach as well as the supervision officer in a secured environment. It was ensured that messages and feedback for guided tasks has been provided within 36 hours by the coach. In order to enhance the extrinsic motivation of participants, an automatic reward system is integrated based on a gamification approach. That is, participants receive coins and virtual awards for each finished content block. The coins can be changed into Euros, if the participant has collected at least 15 Euros, he can request the payout online. The participant can receive a maximum compensation of 120 Euro. Finally, an online first aid kit was provided for each user and filled with individual skills prepared by the user itself during guided tasks in the intervention arm. In the placebo arm, the first add kit was not individualized but pre-filled with basic hints. Throughout all modules, the speech was friendly, empathetic, simple, and easy to understand (e.g., no technical terms, examples of everyday life) in order to account for the different cognitive functioning level of participants.

Already established therapeutic concepts from in-face community-based treatment programs for individuals who committed sexual offenses against children [@brikenPraeventionSexuellenKindesmissbrauchs2017; @wildPreventionSexualChild2020] as well as cognitive-behavioral treatment concepts build the theoretical ground of the WBI; see @frombergerMyTabuAPlaceboControlled2021 for more details. The in-face programs have been adapted for online use. Both programs have been designed for CSA as well as CSEM offenders. Parts relevant to the meaningful risk factors of both in-face programs have been digitalized and parts on risk factors not supported by empirical evidence have been skipped in order to shorten the WBI. The content of the intervention arm focused exclusively on psychological meaningful risk factors [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023], see @fig-wbi-overview for an overview of the theoretical concept of the WBI. To achieve a reduction in re-offenses, it seems to be most promising to target dynamic factors, which are changeable and strong associated with recidivism [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023]. Mann et al. (2010) introduced the term meaningful psychological risk factors for sexual offending by identifying those risk factors in the literature, which are dynamic and therefore changeable by treatment and are empirically proved in enhancing the risk for recidivism. Recently, Seto et al. (2023) replicated the findings and proofed the meaningful risk factors with a broader and more recent literature basis. The emprirical basis for risk factors for CSAM-exclusive offences is not as broad as for sexual offending in the sense of in-person offences. @babchishinChildSexualExploitation2018 elaborated in their review risk factors for CSEM-exclusive offenders. Atypical sexual interests, sexual pre-occupation, sexual arousal, access to the internet and children, and distorted cognitions are assumed to play a key role in recidivism. Thus, there is a overlap between risk factors for CSA offenses and risk factors for CSAM offenses [@reichelReviewRiskFactors2024]. But it is assumed, that e.g. the content of offense-supportive attitudes differs from the content of offense-supportive attitudes for mixed offenders or CSA-exclusive offenders. Access to children or the internet is a so-called facilitating factor in the sense of the Motivation-Facilitation Model of sexual offending and therefore only indirect changeable by treatment [@setoMotivationFacilitationModelSexual2019]. In consequence, addressed risk factore were the same for participants with CSA offences and participants with CSEM offences. Virtual participants (four male and one female offender with different offense histories) accompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor). Guided exercises are used at the core of cognitive-behavioral treatment within the WBI. Guided exercises have been developed to train important new concepts online. They ensure, that the participants have to think about the previous contents to answer them correctly, since the online coach reviews the answers. Additionally, guided exercises are the most probable content block in which the online coach gets in touch with the participant (see @fig-act-guided-task). All modules within the intervention arm comprised techniques of motivational interviewing [@rollnickMotivationalInterviewingTreatment2015] to enhance or maintain the motivation of the participants. The WBI is designed for female as well as male participants, but due to a lack of knowledge with regard to specific risk factors for female sex offenders at development of the HBI, the content remains identical for women and men. In order to make the WBI suitable for female participants, the used language was adapted and one female virtual participant has been designed and integrated.

The placebo arm was developed to ensure the same mode, dose, and amount of support and attention by supporting online coaches as in the intervention arm - but the content of the modules was unrelated to meaningful dynamic risk factors. The content of the placebo condition comprised information on healthy living, e.g., healthy nutrition, physical activities, or healthy sleep. The amount of guided exercises was the same as in the intervention arm (n = 29 guided exercises), but the exercises have been specifically designed to not induce any sustainable effect. The content of the WBI is available online under an open-source license.
