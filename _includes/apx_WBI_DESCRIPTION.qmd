### Structure of WBI

The WBI \@myTabu consists of three isolated sections, one only for participants, one only for the online coaches, and one section for community supervisors (see @fig-sitemap). The access to these sections was secured by username and password full-filling the criteria of the DSGVO. On the landing page of the coach section, a dashboard informs the coach on tasks he has to perform (e.g. unanswered messages by a client, open guided tasks). Each coach had only access to the participants he was responsible for. The landing page links to the in-app messenger and a page for working on guided tasks together with the participant.
The supervisor section, only accessible by participating community supervisors, provides a landing page which summarized important key aspects (treatment progress, critical events) of all participants, which have been supervised by this supervisor. Due to security reasons, the supervisor was able to see the raw values of the primary endpoint. If a item of the primary endpoint has been graded as a potential hint to recidivism by lawyers within the research team during development of the app, additional judicial information are provided specifically for the federal state the supervision officer is working at.

The participant section, only accessible by participants, provides on the landing page key aspects of their progress, e.g. current saldo, gudied exercises the have to work on, a help page, a first aid kit as well as a section for the WBI. The participants are remembered on open guided tasks or being late with the intervention by in-app alerts. The WBI starts with two introductory sessions, in order to explain the participants how the app works. After finishing the instruction section, the participants is linked to the first lection of the WBI. The structure and organization of the content was identical across both trial arms. The WBI was structured into six modules, each module into four sessions and each session into six to eight lections. A lection was divided into different content blocks: guided exercises, psychoeducation, examples (virtual participants), and automated exercises. Virtual participants accompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor)At the beginning of each session, key elements from the previous session or module were recapped. At the end of each session, the most important points of that session or module were summarized. Content created during exercises was partly dynamic integrated in consecutive sessions. For example, at the start of the intervention participants created a list of positive activities, which was later used to suggest ways in which they could reward themselves for completing a session or module. In both trial arms, the program included digital psycho-educational blocks incorporating multimedia elements such as videos and graphics, as well as guided and unguided exercises. A total of eighteen different online exercises (e.g., fill‑in‑the‑gap tasks, multiple‑choice questions, four-field-tasks) were integrated into the WBI. These exercises were either offered as self‑guided tasks with automated feedback or as coach‑guided tasks in which feedback was provided by online coaches. In the intervention arm, the most relevant aspects of each session were delivered as guided tasks. In the placebo arm, the allocation of tasks as guided or unguided was determined based on a predefined matching procedure to replicate the distribution of guided and unguided tasks in the intervention arm. The feedback of the online coaches was manualized: Within a special section of the WBI, the coach was able to choose pre-build templates for each guided task (see @fig-act-guided-task). Furthermore, an in-app messaging system allowed the user to communicate with the online coach as well as the supervision officer in a secured environment. It was ensured that messages and feedback for guided tasks has been provided within 36 hours by the coach. In order to enhance the extrinsic motivation of participants, an automatic reward system is integrated based on a gamification approach. That is, participants receive coins and virtual awards for each finished content block. The coins can be changed into Euros, if the participant has collected at least 15 Euros, he can request the payout online. The participant can receive a maximum compensation of 120 Euro. Finally, an online first aid kit was provided for each user and filled with individual skills prepared by the user itself during guided tasks in the intervention arm. In the placebo arm, the first add kit was not individualized but pre-filled with basic hints. Throughout all modules, the speech was friendly, empathetic, simple, and easy to understand (e.g., no technical terms, examples of everyday life) in order to account for the different cognitive functioning level of participants.

### Theoretical foundation

Already established therapeutic concepts from in-face community-based treatment programs for individuals who committed sexual offenses against children [@brikenPraeventionSexuellenKindesmissbrauchs2017; @wildPreventionSexualChild2020] as well as cognitive-behavioral treatment concepts build the theoretical ground of the WBI; see @frombergerMyTabuAPlaceboControlled2021 for more details. The in-person programs have been adapted for online use. Both programs have been designed for CSA as well as CSEM offenders. Parts relevant to the meaningful risk factors of both in-face programs have been digitalized and parts on risk factors not supported by empirical evidence have been skipped in order to shorten the WBI. The content of the intervention arm focused exclusively on psychological meaningful risk factors [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023], see @fig-wbi-overview for an overview of the theoretical concept of the WBI. To achieve a reduction in re-offenses, it seems to be most promising to target dynamic factors, which are changeable and strong associated with recidivism [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023]. Mann et al. (2010) introduced the term meaningful psychological risk factors for sexual offending by identifying those risk factors in the literature, which are dynamic and therefore changeable by treatment and are empirically proved in enhancing the risk for recidivism. Recently, Seto et al. (2023) replicated the findings and proofed the meaningful risk factors with a broader and more recent literature basis. The emprirical basis for risk factors for CSAM-exclusive offences is not as broad as for sexual offending in the sense of in-person offences. @babchishinChildSexualExploitation2018 elaborated in their review risk factors for CSEM-exclusive offenders. Atypical sexual interests, sexual pre-occupation, sexual arousal, access to the internet and children, and distorted cognitions are assumed to play a key role in recidivism. Thus, there is a overlap between risk factors for CSA offenses and risk factors for CSAM offenses [@reichelReviewRiskFactors2024]. But it is assumed, that e.g. the content of offense-supportive attitudes differs from the content of offense-supportive attitudes for mixed offenders or CSA-exclusive offenders. Access to children or the internet is a so-called facilitating factor in the sense of the Motivation-Facilitation Model of sexual offending and therefore only indirect changeable by treatment [@setoMotivationFacilitationModelSexual2019]. In consequence, addressed risk factore were the same for participants with CSA offences and participants with CSEM offences. Virtual participants (four male and one female offender with different offense histories) accompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor). Guided exercises are used at the core of cognitive-behavioral treatment within the WBI. Guided exercises have been developed to train important new concepts online. They ensure, that the participants have to think about the previous contents to answer them correctly, since the online coach reviews the answers. Additionally, guided exercises are the most probable content block in which the online coach gets in touch with the participant (see @fig-act-guided-task). All modules within the intervention arm comprised techniques of motivational interviewing [@rollnickMotivationalInterviewingTreatment2015] to enhance or maintain the motivation of the participants. The WBI is designed for female as well as male participants, but due to a lack of knowledge with regard to specific risk factors for female sex offenders at development of the WBI, the content remains identical for women and men. In order to make the WBI suitable for female participants, the used language was adapted and one female virtual participant has been designed and integrated. The placebo arm was developed to ensure the same mode, dose, and amount of support and attention by supporting online coaches as in the intervention arm - but the content of the modules was unrelated to meaningful dynamic risk factors. The content of the placebo condition comprised information on healthy living, e.g., healthy nutrition, physical activities, or healthy sleep. The amount of guided exercises was the same as in the intervention arm (n = 29 guided exercises), but the exercises have been specifically designed to not induce any sustainable effect. In the following paragraphs, the theoretical backgorund of each module is described in detail.

#### Module 1: Motivation

Ward et al. identify motivation to change and subsequent treatment engagement as intermediate targets that must be addressed before criminogenic needs can be modified. [@wardMultifactorOffenderReadiness2004] Empirical evidence indicates that higher treatment motivation is associated with greater therapeutic success among individuals who committed CSA offences and with programme dropout in web‑based interventions for alcohol use disorder. [@terryMotivationSexOffender2001; @postelEffectivenessWebbasedIntervention2010] Reviews of web‑based interventions suggest that most treatment discontinuation occurs before the active treatment phase begins and that the timing of dropout is comparable between in‑person and therapist‑guided web‑based treatments. [@melvilleDropoutInternetbasedTreatment2010] As motivation to change is likely to influence treatment engagement, outcomes, and dropout among ICCO, these findings highlight the importance of addressing motivation at the outset of the study. [@terryMotivationSexOffender2001; @postelEffectivenessWebbasedIntervention2010] The motivation module is therefore grounded in motivational interviewing principles, which conceptualise behavioural change as a process marked by ambivalence. [@rollnickMotivationalInterviewingTreatment2015] Therapists support participants in exploring reasons for and against change, with a focus on personal values and goal setting to foster intrinsic motivation. The approach is guided by four core principles—expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, avoiding argumentation, and supporting self‑efficacy—implemented through open‑ended questioning, reflective listening, affirmations, change‑talk strategies, resistance management, confidence‑building techniques, and summaries.

#### Module 2: Supervision and social relationships

Theoretical and empirical models of criminal behaviour underscore the relevance of social influences for recidivism. [@andrewsPsychologyCriminalConduct2010] Negative social environments and resistance to rules and supervision have been identified as meaningful risk factors for sexual reoffending. [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023; @hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004] Accordingly, interventions for ICCO under CS should promote the development of protective social networks. Such networks extend beyond family and peers to include therapists, supervision officers, and social workers. The supervision and social relationships module of \@myTabu therefore aims to strengthen motivation to establish positive social connections and to reduce resistance to supervision through psychoeducational and cognitive‑behavioural techniques, including the illustration of associations between negative social networks and reoffending and the provision of strategies to disengage from criminogenic influences. A further established risk factor for sexual reoffending is the absence of emotionally intimate adult relationships. [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] Individuals who have committed sexual offences and maintain stable adult partnerships show lower recidivism rates than those who do not, and deficits in emotionally intimate adult relationships are linearly associated with sexual reoffending. [@hansonAssessingRiskSexual2007; @hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004] Consequently, this module provides information on these associations and offers guidance to support the development of emotionally intimate adult relationships. To date, the effectiveness of the specific supervision‑related content described here has not been empirically evaluated, either in in‑person or in web‑based interventions.

#### Module 3: Emotion management

Lifestyle impulsiveness as a pattern characterised by low self‑control, instability in employment and housing, absence of meaningful daily routines, irresponsible decision‑making, and limited or unrealistic long‑term goals is associated with recdivism. Lifestyle impulsiveness is a well‑established risk factor for sexual reoffending with a broad empirical base. [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] For dysfunctional coping, Knight and Thornton demonstrated that external coping—defined as a tendency to respond to stressful and negatively valenced emotional events in a reckless and impulsive manner—predicts sexual recidivism. [@knightEvaluatingImprovingRisk2007] To address these risk factors, \@myTabu integrates skills training derived from Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT [@linehanCourseEvolutionDialectical2015]) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT [@hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy1999]) with the aim of reducing impulsivity and strengthening coping capacities in response to stressful or negatively experienced life events. DBT skills training targets emotion regulation and distress tolerance by teaching alternative behavioural strategies to replace external or sexualised coping. DBT has previously been shown to reduce impulsive behaviour in forensic populations, and web‑based interventions based on DBT principles have demonstrated effectiveness, particularly in reducing stress, across several psychiatric conditions. [@berzinsDevelopmentImplementationDialectical2004; @spijkermanEffectivenessOnlineMindfulnessbased2016; @jayawardeneEffectsPreventiveOnline2016] ACT focuses on fostering a meaningful life by promoting acceptance of negative internal experiences and providing strategies for adaptive responses to emotional distress. [@hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy1999] ACT has been successfully applied in offender treatment settings and has shown promising results when delivered via web‑based interventions for various psychiatric disorders. [@spijkermanEffectivenessOnlineMindfulnessbased2016; @jayawardeneEffectsPreventiveOnline2016; @lanzaAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy2014]

#### Module 4: Problem solving
Meta‑analyses have demonstrated a significant association between poor social problem‑solving abilities and sexual recidivism. [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] Social problem solving is defined as a self‑directed cognitive‑behavioural process through which individuals attempt to identify and implement effective solutions to problems encountered in everyday life. [@dzurillaSocialProblemSolving2004] Within the widely accepted cognitive model proposed by D’Zurilla and Goldfried, problem solving comprises two dimensions: problem orientation and problem‑solving style. Problem orientation may be positive (PPO) or negative (NPO). PPO is associated with adaptive coping and reduced emotional distress, whereas NPO is linked to avoidance and ineffective coping strategies. [@dzurillaProblemSolvingBehavior1971]
According to this model, three problem‑solving styles can be distinguished: rational problem solving (RPS), impulsive coping style (ICS), and avoidance style (AS). RPS involves a systematic and planned application of skills to achieve adaptive solutions. In contrast, ICS is characterised by unsystematic responses, often involving the implementation of the first available option, while AS is marked by avoidance of problems and reliance on external solutions.
Empirical evidence indicates that ICCO exhibit higher levels of NPO and lower levels of PPO than the general population and show a greater tendency towards ICS and AS compared with RPS. [@nezuProblemSolvingTherapyTreatment2013] Moreover, poor problem‑solving skills in this population have been shown to be amenable to change through psychological interventions. [@wakelingPsychometricValidationSocial2007; @mcguireReviewEffectiveInterventions2008] The problem‑solving module therefore aims to improve deficient problem‑solving skills by drawing on the well‑established principles of Problem‑Solving Therapy (PST [@nezuProblemSolvingTherapyTreatment2013]). The module focuses on fostering a positive problem orientation and strengthening rational problem‑solving skills.

#### Module 5: Offense‑supportive cognitions
Offense‑supportive attitudes among ICCO can be summarised as beliefs that children are capable of sexually mature relationships, are not harmed by sexual contact with adults, or actively provoke sexual behaviour in adults. [@mannTreatingCognitiveComponents2016; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] These attitudes must be clearly distinguished from attempts to excuse or justify one’s own specific offences, which should not be the focus of cognitive treatment. [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010] A meta‑analysis by Helmus et al. demonstrated that only offense‑supportive attitudes, as defined above, constitute a psychologically meaningful risk factor in terms of predicting sexual recidivism among ICCO. [@helmusAttitudesSupportiveSexual2013] In contrast, offence‑specific justifications have not been shown to be predictive and are therefore not considered primary targets of intervention. The offense‑supportive attitudes module applies cognitive restructuring to modify offense‑supportive beliefs. Cognitive restructuring is the most widely used and best‑evaluated technique for changing maladaptive cognitions in this population. Modifying implicit theories, attitudes, and beliefs is challenging, particularly among ICCO, as such beliefs may not be experienced as harmful by the individual and may instead serve to minimise perceived harm resulting from their own offences. [@mannTreatingCognitiveComponents2016] Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated that cognitive restructuring can effectively reduce implicit offense‑supportive beliefs and attitudes. [@beechAssessmentTreatmentDistorted2013]

#### Module 6: Sexuality

Individuals who have committed sexual offences have been shown to be more sexually active and more strongly interested in sexual topics than non‑offending individuals. [@lalumiereTestMateDeprivation1996] Sexual preoccupation is characterised by intrusive sexual thoughts and behaviours that are difficult or impossible to control (84) and has been shown to be strongly associated with sexual reoffending. [@hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004] Accordingly, a primary aim of the sexuality module is to provide basic knowledge about sexuality and to support the reduction of excessive sexual thoughts and behaviours. The module further aims to increase awareness of high‑risk situations that may trigger sexual thoughts and behaviours. Participants are provided with strategies to manage and, where possible, reduce sexual preoccupation by limiting sexual thoughts and activities. Emotional congruence with children represents another central risk factor addressed in the sexuality module. ICCO under CS may experience a perceived emotional closeness to children and, when identifying themselves with children, may find it easier to initiate contact with them. [@matthesDeutscheVersionStable20072008] Emotional congruence with children is therefore considered a risk factor strongly associated with sexual reoffending. [@wardIntegratedTheorySexual2006] The sexuality module seeks to reduce emotional congruence with children through psychoeducational approaches, emphasising that emotionally equal relationships between adults and children are not possible and providing strategies to establish greater emotional distance from children.
Sexual interest in children, including sexual fantasies involving children, constitutes one of the most important risk factors for sexual reoffending among ICCO [@setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023] and has been described as a potential motivational factor underlying sexual abuse of children. [@wardDynamicRiskFactors2016] Reducing sexual interest in children while strengthening non‑deviant sexual interests may therefore contribute to risk reduction. The extent to which sexual interests can change across the lifespan remains debated, and empirical evidence is currently insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. [@olverEvaluatingChangeMen2020] Clinically, both changes in sexual interests and highly persistent pedophilic interests have been observed, supporting the conceptualisation of sexual interest in children as a dynamic risk factor that may change over time. [@olverEvaluatingChangeMen2020] Within the sexuality module, cognitive‑behavioural techniques are applied to influence sexual interest in and, where possible, sexual fantasies about children, while promoting sexual interest in adults. The techniques employed in this module have demonstrated effectiveness in in‑person treatments and, at least among younger individuals, have also been applied in web‑based interventions.
