### The \@myTabu WBI in detail {.appendix}

The HBI \@myTabu consists of three isolated sections, one only for participants, one only for the coaches and one section only for supervisors. The access to these sections was secured by username and password to full-fill criteria of the DSGVO. On the landing page of the coach section, a dashboard informs the coach on tasks he has to perform (e.g. unanswered messages by a client, open guided tasks). Each coach had only access to the participants he was responsible for. The landing page links to the in-app messenger and a page for working on guided tasks together with the participant.

The supervisor section, only accessible by participating community supervisors, provides a landing page which summarized important key aspects (treatment progress, critical events) of all participants, which have been supervised by this supervisor. Due to security reasons, the supervisor was able to see the raw values of the primary endpoint [UND NOCH VIEL MEHR]. If a item of the primary endpoint has been graded as a potential hint to recidivism by lawyers within the research team during development of the app, additional judicial information have been provided. Furthermore, each supervisor has to fill in a questionnaire at baseline about demographic and criminological characteristics of the participant as well as every four weeks during the course of the clinical trial of his client in order to assess changes from baseline.

The structure and organization of the content were identical across both trial arms. At the beginning of each session, key elements from the previous session or module were recapped. At the end of each session, the most important points of that session or module were summarized. Content created during exercises was partly dynamic integrated in consecutive sessions. For example, at the start of the intervention participants created a list of positive activities, which was later used to suggest ways in which they could reward themselves for completing a session or module. In both trial arms, the program included digital psycho-educational blocks incorporating multimedia elements such as videos and graphics, as well as guided and unguided exercises. A total of eighteen different online exercises (e.g., fill‑in‑the‑gap tasks, multiple‑choice questions) were integrated into the HBI. These exercises were either offered as self‑guided tasks with automated feedback or as coach‑guided tasks in which feedback was provided by online coaches. In the intervention arm, the most relevant aspects of each session were delivered as guided tasks. In the placebo arm, the allocation of tasks as guided or unguided was determined based on a predefined matching procedure to replicate the distribution of guided and unguided tasks in the intervention arm. The feedback of the online coaches was manualized: Within a special section of the HBI, the coach was able to choose one out of XX pre-build answers for each guided task \[BEARBEITUNG DER ÜBUNGEN UND WIE COACH FEEDBACK GAB GENAUER ERKLÄREN\]. Furthermore, an in-app messaging system allowed the user to communicate in real-time with the online coach as well as the supervision officer. It was ensured that messages and feedback for guided tasks has been provided within 36 hours by the coach. Finally, an online first aid kit was provided for each user and filled with individual skills prepared by the user itself during guided tasks in the intervention arm. In the placebo arm, the first add kit was not individualized but pre-filled with basic hints. Throughout all modules, the speech was friendly, empathetic, simple, and easy to understand (e.g., no technical terms, examples of everyday life) in order to account for the different cognitive functioning level of participants.

Im teilnehmerbereich wurden auf der landing page übersichtlich alle wichtigen Informationen dargeboten (wie man weiter machen kann, ob noch guided tasks bearbeitet werden müssen, ob Fragebögen beantwortet werden müssen, ob neue Nachrichten vorhanden sind). zudem gab es links zu den Avataren, Geldwechsel, in-app messenger, guided-task review board...

Additionally, an in-app alert was shown to the supervision officer about unanswered messages, critical events and time delay of a participant.

### Content of intervention arm {.appendix}

[am besten Tabelle mit Inhalt per module (oder per session)]

The content of the intervention arm focused exclusively on psychological meaningful risk factors [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023]. Already established therapeutic concepts from in-face community-based treatment programs for individuals who committed sexual offenses against children [@brikenPraeventionSexuellenKindesmissbrauchs2017; @wildPreventionSexualChild2020] as well as cognitive-behavioral treatment concepts [see @tbl-sec-outcomes and @frombergerMyTabuAPlaceboControlled2021 for more details] have been adapted for be used online. Both programs have been designed for CSA as well as CSAM offenders. Parts relevant to the meaningful risk factors of both in-face programs have been digitalized and parts on risk factors not supported by empirical evidence have been skipped in order to shorten the HBI. Virtual participants (four male and one female with different offense histories [CSAM exclusive, CSA-exclusive, one released from high security hospital, one from prison and so on.....NOCH GENAU BESCHREIBEN]) accompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor). All modules within the intervention arm comprised techniques of motivational interviewing [@rollnickMotivationalInterviewingTreatment2015] to enhance or maintain the motivation of the participants. The WBI is designed for female as well as male participants, but due to a lack of knowledge with regard to specific risk factors for female sex offenders at development of the HBI, the content remains identical for women and men. In order to make the HBI suitable for female participants, the used language was adapted and one female virtual participant has been designed and integrated.

Since the treatment programs \@myTabu is based on, are following slightly different theoretical frameworks, the intervention must be defined as an eclectic treatment approach. The intervention is based in cognitive-behavioral treatment techniques, follows the GLM and partly the RNR approach and integrates techniques from DBT and other third wave psychotherapy.

### Content of placebo arm {.appendix}

[am besten Tabelle mit Inhalt per module (oder per session)]

The placebo arm was developed to ensure the same mode, dose, and amount of support and attention by supporting online coaches as in the intervention arm - but the content of the modules was unrelated to meaningful dynamic risk factors. The content of the placebo condition comprised information on healthy living, e.g., healthy nutrition, physical activities, or healthy sleep. The amount of exercises was the same as in the experimental condition but exercises are specifically designed to not induce any sustainable effect. The entire content of the HBI is available online under an open-source license after publication (LINK will be provided after publication).
