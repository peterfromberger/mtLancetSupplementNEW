## Results

Between March 01, 2020, and Septembre 30, 2024, n = 385 individulas who committed sexual offenses against children have been screened for eligibility, of whom 16 have not been randomized. The trial was closed at Septembre 30, 2024 before all participants have been able to finish the web-based intervention due to a lack of further funding. N = 369 individuals were randomly assigned, n = 182 to the placebo arm and n = 187 to the intervention arm. One individual was excluded from analysis due to misallocation to the intervention arm. N = 213 participants have been included in the ITT sample (n = 107 in the intervention arm and n = 106 in the placebo arm). [@fig-consort-flowchart-detailed] shows the CONSORT flowchart. Overall, n = 99 participants finished the WBI, n = 44 (30.20%) in the intervention arm and n = 55 (22.40%) in the placebo arm. Only two female participants were randomized, of whom one enters the ITT sample. All participants (n = 213 [100%]) in the ITT sample had the German nationality, data on ethnicity has not been assessed. Due to technical reasons, six participants of the ITT sample (n = 3 [0.03%] in the intervention arm, n = 3 [0.03%] in the placebo arm) data points of one measurement time point are missing (see @fig-consort-flowchart-detailed).

### Follow-up

Overall, n = 124 participants dropped out. Dropout-reasons as reported by the supervision officers are shown in @tbl-exclusion-reasons. One participant of the intervention arm was excluded by the prinicpal investigator due to unwillingness to work seriously on the HBI. All other dropouts participants have been excluded by their responsible community supervisor.

### Protocol deviations

Participants of both trial arms have been advised to work on each session within seven days, on each module within 28 days and to finish the HBI within 196 days. As [@fig-time-to-finish-module-itt-boxplot] shows, the time participants needed for finishing the consecutive modules of the HBI differs from the advised time, in some modules in a statistically significant manner. [@tbl-deviance-from-advised-time-frequency] shows the frequency of protocol deviations and results of fisher's exact tests with regard to advised time. In the Fisher's exact tests, three module comparisons showed statistically significant differences between the intervention and placebo arm based on unadjusted p‑values. For Module 3, participants in the intervention arm more often needs more time to finish a moduel than advised (n = 68, 99%) compared to the placebo arm (n = 67, 89%), while the As advised category occurred exclusively in the placebo group (n = 6, 8.0% vs. n = 0, 0%). This difference was statistically significant before adjustment (Cramér’s V = 0.210; p = 0.029), but did not remain significant after Holm‑Bonferroni adjustment (q = 0.12). For Module 4, the durations as advised were observed less frequently in the intervention group (n = 1, 1.6%) compared to the placebo group (n = 10, 15%), whereas longer durations remained the dominant in both groups (n = 57, 93% vs. n = 55, 81%). This difference reached statistical significance before adjustment (Cramér’s V = 0.230; p = 0.024), but fell short of significance after correction for multiple testing (q = 0.12). For Module 5, the shorter times were reported more often in the intervention group (n = 4, 8.0%) compared to none in the placebo group, with longer times being the most frequent outcome in both groups (n = 45, 90% vs. n = 48, 87%). The difference was significant before adjustment (Cramér’s V = 0.280; p = 0.013) and showed a trend after adjustment (q = 0.078). All other modules have not reached statistical significance (all p ≥ 0.075), but showed a comparable figure with longer times as advised with the highest frequency and low ferquency of participants finished the module in the advised time. In consequence, time to finish modules has been considered as covariable in the MMRMs for the primary endpoints in an exploratively manner.

Interestingly, the reasons for these protocol deviations seems not to be

### Baseline characteristics

[@tbl-baseline-characteristics] shows sociodemographic, criminological and mental health baseline characteristics (see Supplementary material pp. XXX for all assessed baseline characteristics). With regard to strata, only n = 89 (40%) participants of the ITT sample were mixed offenders (at least one conviction §176 ff StGB; n = 44 [41%] in the intervention arm and n = 45 [40%] in the placebo arm) and n = 132 (60%) were hands-off offenders (only convictions based on $184b StGB; n = 64 [59%] in the intervention arm and n = 68 [60%] in the placebo arm). The majority of  participants (n = 176 [80%]) were under community supervision (Bewährungshilfe §§56, 57 StGB; n = 88 [81%] in the intervention arm and n = 88 [78%] in the placebo arm). Only n = 45 (20%) have been under post-release supervision (Führungsaufsicht §§68 ff StGB; n = 20 [19%] in the intervention arm and n = 25 [22%] in the placebo arm). N = 70 (32%) of the ITT sample had additional external treatment in addition to community supervision as usual (n = 33 [31%] in the intervention arm and n = 37 [33%] in the placebo arm), n = 151 (68%) had no additional treatment (n = 75 [69%] in the intervention arm and n = 76 [67%] in the placebo arm). The majority of participants (n = 180 [81%]) had a low static risk to re-offend at baseline (n = 87 [81%] in the intervention arm and n = 93 [82%] in the placebo arm). N = 41 (19%) had a low-medium, medium-high or high risk to re-offend (n = 21 [19%] in the intervention arm and n = 20 [18%] in the placebo arm).

<!-- {{< include _includes/tbl_baseline_characteristics.qmd >}} -->

Overall, n = 70 (32%) of the ITT sample received an external (f2f) treatment during participation (psychotherapy and/or medical treatment), but the court ordered this for n = 124 (56%). Only n = 48 (38.71%) of all participants who have an ordered treatment also in fact received external treatment at enrolement, the majority (n = 76; 61.29%) not.

### Main outcome

The mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) for the CARES total score showed no significant group differences for the interaction term timepoint × treatment (all p‑values ≥ 0.149; see [@tbl-prim-cares-mmrm]). The β estimates for the intervention group compared to the placebo group were 0.11 at module one, −1.20 at module two, −0.30 at module three, −0.39 at module four, 0.62 at module five, and 0.02 at module six. The factor Additional treatment showed a trend-level effect, with participants receiving additional treatment having lower scores (β = −1.10; p = 0.096). Similarly, Conviction revealed a trend, indicating that participants with only §184b StGB convictions (“hands-off”) had lower CARES total scores compared to those with at least one conviction under §§176 ff StGB (“hands-on”) (β = −1.20; p = 0.076). A strong and highly significant positive association was found for baseline scores, (β = 0.87; p < 0.001). Static recidivism risk (baseline) showed a non-significant positive association (β = 0.45; p = 0.108), and no significant effect was observed for Type of supervision (β = 0.57; p = 0.499). Regarding timepoint, a significant increase was observed at module two compared to module one (β = 0.99; p = 0.047), while all other modules showed no significant differences. Also, the explorative MMRM for the CARES total score with the additional covariate time since start of module 1 showed no significant group differences for the interaction term timepoint × treatment (all p‑values ≥ 0.293; see [@tbl-iod-reduced-mmrm-explorative-time-since-first-module]) as well as the explorative MMRM with the additional covariate time since recruitment (all p‑values ≥ 0.284; see [@tbl-iod-reduced-mmrm-explorative-time-since-recruitment]).

{{< include _includes/tbl_prim_CARES_mmrm.qmd >}}

Explorative pairwise comparisons of the difference from baseline scores between treatment arms revealed a statistical trend at module two (p = 0.051; p adj. = 0.31). The difference from baseline was lower in the intervention arm (M = -0.3 ± 3.9 SD) than in the placebo arm (M = 1.0  ± 5.5 SD). All other comparisons showed none significant results (all p-values ≥ 0.53; see [@tbl-prim-cares-diffscore]). Exploratory pre–post comparisons of the CARES total score within the intervention arm showed a significant decrease for module one (t = -2.85, p = 0.0050; Holm–Bonferroni q = 0.030; estimated relative effect p̂ = 0.451, 95% CI [0.417, 0.485]). The mean total score decreased from 14 ± 8 SD pre to 12 ± 9 SD post. All other modules showed no statistically significant changes (all p-values ≥ 0.15 see @tbl-prim-cares-pre-post-pairwise-intervention). Exploratory pre–post comparisons within the placebo arm showed a significant decrease for module one (t = -3.88, p < 0.0001; Holm–Bonferroni q < 0.0001; estimated relative effect p̂ = 0.428, 95% CI [0.392, 0.465]). The mean score decreased from 12 ± 8 SD pre to 11 ± 9 SD post. Two modules showed nominal pre–post differences that did not survive multiplicity adjustment: Supervision and social relationships (p = 0.050, q = 0.24) suggesting a slight increase, and Emotion management (p = 0.047, q = 0.24) suggesting a decrease. All other modules showed no statistically significant changes (all p ≥ 0.54; see [@tbl-prim-cares-pre-post-pairwise-placebo]).

Explorative analysis of the primary endpoint, as initially defined in the SAP, reveals no divergent results: the MMRM shows no significant group differences for the interaction term timepoint × treatment (all p‑values ≥ 0.588; see [@tbl-prim-mmrm]).

### Secondary outcomes

[@tbl-sec-pairwise-intervention] shows descriptive statistics and the results of the pairwise comparisons for each secondary endpoint for the intervention arm. In the intervention arm, three measures demonstrated statistically significant pre–post differences. The CVTRQ total score increased from 84 ± 7 SD at pre-measurement to 86 ± 8 SD at post-measurement (p = 0.0060, q = 0.078), indicating improved treatment readiness. The DERS impulsivity subscale score rose from M = 6.24 ± 2.26 SD to M = 6.72 ± 2.25 SD (p = 0.0050, q = 0.070), suggesting an increase in impulsivity-related difficulties. In contrast, the ESIQ total score decreased from M = 90 ± 12 SD to M = 87 ± 12 SD (p = 0.0010, q = 0.015), reflecting a reduction in explicit sexual interests. One measure reached nominal significance but did not survive adjustment: the SSIC score increased slightly from M = 26.5 ± 4.6 SD to M = 27.1 ± 4.3 SD (p = 0.049, q = 0.59), indicating a possible, though not statistically robust, enhancement in perceived self-efficacy. The SOI-R subscale score decreased from M = 11 ± 20 SD to M = 9 ± 21 SD (p = 0.071, q = 0.79), suggesting a potential reduction in the desire for sexual activity with children, although this change did not reach statistical significance after adjustment. Several additional measures showed statistical trends. The UCLA total score decreased from M = 28.5 ± 3.9 SD to M = 28.0 ± 4.1 SD (p = 0.066, q = 0.73), suggesting a possible reduction in loneliness levels. The OQMPR score decreased from M = 29 ± 9 SD to M = 28 ± 9 SD (p = 0.084, q = 0.84), indicating a potential reduction in psychological reactance. All other measures, including RCQ, F-Soz-U, BIS-15, CUSI, NARQ (externalizing strategies), SPSI-R, BMS, EKK-R, and HBI-19, did not show significant pre–post differences (all p-value ≥ 0.13).

<!-- {{< include _includes/tbl_sec_pairwise_intervention.qmd >}} -->

[@tbl-sec-pairwise-placebo] shows descriptive statistics and the results of the pairwise comparisons for each secondary endpoint for the placebo arm. In the placebo arm, only one measure demonstrated a statistically significant pre–post difference. The F-Soz-U total score increased from M = 3.74 ± 0.84 SD at pre-measurement to M = 3.88 ± 0.89 SD at post-measurement (p = 0.0030, q = 0.045), indicating improved perceived social support. No additional measures reached nominal significance (p < 0.05 without adjustment), and no outcomes showed statistical trends. All other measures, including CVTRQ, RCQ, OQMPR, UCLA, BIS-15, CUSI, DERS impulsivity, NARQ externalizing strategies, SPSI-R, BMS, ESIQ, SOI-R, SSIC, EKK-R, and HBI-19, did not show significant pre–post differences (all p-values ≥ 0.12).

<!-- {{< include _includes/tbl_sec_pairwise_placebo.qmd >}} -->

Exploratory subscale analysis of the CVTRQ demonstrated only on the subscale Attitudes and Motivation a significant difference in the intervention arm (p < 0.0001, q < 0.0001) with lower values before module one (M = 26.29 ± 3.01 SD) than after module one (M = 27.19 ± 2.83 SD). All other subscales showed no significant difference or statistically trend in the intervention arm (all p 0.11; see [@tbl-sec-cvtrq-subscores-pairwise-intervention]). Further exploratory subscale analysis within the intervention arm for the ESIQ showed a significant difference before (M = 47 ± 9 SD) and after module six (M = 44 ± 8 SD) on the subscale Fantasy (p > 0.0001, q < 0.0001). For the subscale Behavior there was a statistical trend with in the intervention arm (p = 0.065, q = 0.065; see [@tbl-sec-esiq-subscores-pairwise-intervention]).

Exploratory analysis of differences from baseline of secondary endpoints revealed two questionnaires demonstrating statistically significant differences between the placebo and intervention arms (see [@tbl-prim-cares-diffscore]). The ESIQ total score decreased in the intervention group (M = –3.6 ± 5.4 SD), while remaining essentially unchanged in the placebo arm (M = –0.1 ± 7.9 SD; p = 0.0020, q = 0.030), reflecting a statistically significant reduction in explicit sexual interests only in the intervention group. The difference from baseline of the DERS impulsivity subscale was higher in the intervention group (M = 0.49 ± 2.10 SD) compared to the placebo arm (M = –0.15 ± 1.24 SD; p = 0.024, q = 0.34), indicating a nominal, but not statistically robust, increase in impulsivity-related difficulties in the intervention group and decrease in the placebo group during module three. One additional questionnaire showed a statistical trend: the SSIC difference from baseline score was slightly higher in the intervention arm (M = 0.6 ± 3.6 SD) compared to the placebo arm (M = 0.1 ± 4.5 SD; p = 0.077, q > 0.99), suggesting a potential, though not statistically supported, improvement in perceived self-efficacy in reducing sexual interest on children. All other measures, including CVTRQ, RCQ, F-Soz-U, OQMPR, UCLA, BIS-15, CUSI, NARQ (externalizing strategies), SPSI-R, BMS, EKK-R, SOI-R, and HBI-19, showed no meaningful differences between groups (all p-values ≥ 0.14, see [@tbl-prim-cares-diffscore]).

### Harms

The interim analysis provided no evidence for the necessity to stopp the trial. During the clinical trial, wether supervision officer nor online coaches reported hints to recidivism or concrete preparation for recidivism in in-app messages or during working on a guided exercises. Kaplan–Meier survival curves for time to first recidivism event (as reported by supervision officers in the EQ) indicated a very low incidence of recidivism in both study arms during the first year after initiation of module 1 [see @fig-kaplan-meyer-recidivism]. After 12 months, the estimated proportion of participants without recidivism was 1.00 (95% CI [0.94, 1.00]) in the intervention group (n = 108) and 0.98 (95% CI [0.88, 1.00]) in the placebo group (n = 113). Two recidivism events were observed in the placebo group, whereas no events occurred in the intervention group. A substantial proportion of participants were censored prior to the 12-month follow-up (47% in the intervention group, 66% in the placebo group; see [@tbl-difference-proportion]). The between-group comparison of the proportions without recidivism at one year (placebo minus intervention arm) yielded a difference of –0.022 (95% CI [–0.12, 0.046]; p = .76), indicating no statistically significant effect of the intervention compared to placebo (see [@tbl-proportion-without-recidivism]).

### Ancillary outcomes

The mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) for the WHO‑5 total score showed no significant group differences for the interaction term timepoint × treatment (all p‑values ≥ 0.11; see [@tbl-prim-who-mmrm]). The β estimates for the intervention group compared to the placebo group were 1.7 at module one (post), −1.8 at module two (before), −1.6 at module two (post), −0.86 at module three (before), −4.5 at module three (post), 0.10 at module four (before), −4.3 at module four (post), −2.4 at module five (before), −2.9 at module five (post), −1.9 at module six (before), and −0.15 at module six (post). The factor Additional treatment showed no significant effect (β = 0.25; p = 0.91), and Type of supervision similarly revealed no significant association (β = −2.9; p = 0.29). No significant effect was observed for Offense type (hands-on vs. hands-off) (β = 1.9; p = 0.40). Static recidivism risk (baseline) showed a non‑significant negative association (β = −0.94; p = 0.30). A strong and highly significant positive association was found for baseline WHO‑5 scores (β = 0.68; p < 0.0001). Regarding timepoint, none of the modules showed significant differences compared to module one (post; all p‑values ≥ 0.24).

Only XX participants provided the QNP, thus no results can be reported. Unfortunately, only n = ??? [STIMMT NICHT!] of potential participants has given informed consent to fill out the QNP. In consequence, we did not analyse this questionnaire.

The mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) for the WAI‑SR total score (coach) showed significant group differences for several timepoint × treatment interaction terms (see [@tbl-anc-wai-coach-mmrm]). The β estimates for the intervention group compared to the placebo group were 2.4 at module two (post; p = 0.025), 3.8 at module three (post; p = 0.0044), 3.4 at module four (post; p = 0.0067), 2.1 at module five (post; p = 0.13), and 4.3 at module six (post; p = 0.0051). The factor Additional treatment showed no significant effect (β = 1.1; p = 0.34), and Type of supervision similarly revealed no significant association (β = 1.2; p = 0.39). No significant effect was observed for Offense type (hands‑on vs. hands‑off) (β = −1.2; p = 0.31). Static recidivism risk (baseline) showed a non‑significant negative association (β = −0.59; p = 0.22). A strong and highly significant positive association was found for baseline WAI‑SR scores (β = 0.67; p < 0.0001). Regarding timepoint, none of the modules showed significant differences compared to module two (post; all p‑values ≥ 0.15).
Pairwise pre–post comparisons for the WAI‑SR total score (coach) revealed statistically significant increases within the intervention arm at module two (post; M = 42 ± 11 SD to M = 44 ± 9 SD; p = 0.0020, q = 0.010) and module six (post; M = 46 ± 11 SD to M = 49 ± 9 SD; p = 0.0040, q = 0.016). These findings indicate an improvement in the therapeutic alliance as perceived by the coach at these timepoints. No other modules in the intervention group showed statistically significant pre–post changes (all q-values ≥ 0.62). In contrast, the placebo arm demonstrated no statistically significant pre–post changes in WAI‑SR scores for any module (all q-values > 0.99; see [@tbl-anc-wai-coach-pre-post-pairwise-intervention] and [@tbl-anc-wai-coach-pre-post-pairwise-placebo]). [Diskussion: This pattern of results supports the significant timepoint × treatment interaction effects detected in the MMRM analysis, showing that improvements in the coach-rated working alliance occurred selectively in the intervention group during module two and module six.]
Exploratory analysis of difference scores for the WAI‑SR total score (coach) between treatment groups revealed two timepoints with nominal or trend-level differences (see [@tbl-anc-wai-coach-diffscore]). The change from module one (pre) to module two (post) was higher in the intervention arm (median = 3 [Q1 = −2, Q3 = 8]) compared to the placebo arm (median = 1 [Q1 = −3, Q3 = 5]; p = 0.025, q = 0.13), suggesting a possible early improvement in the coach-rated working alliance in the intervention group, though this effect did not survive adjustment. A further difference score — from module five (post) to module six (post) — was likewise higher in the intervention group (median = 2 [Q1 = 0, Q3 = 6]) compared to the placebo group (median = 0 [Q1 = −2, Q3 = 4]; p = 0.036, q = 0.14), indicating a potential late-stage improvement, also not statistically robust after adjustment. All other difference scores (modules two to four) showed no meaningful group differences (all q-values ≥ 0.18). This pattern aligns with the MMRM and pairwise comparison findings, indicating that notable gains in coach-rated working alliance tended to occur in the intervention group at early and late stages of the program, without reaching statistical significance after multiple-comparison correction.

The mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) for the WAI‑SR total score (supervisor) showed significant group differences for several timepoint × treatment interaction terms (see [@tbl-prim-wai-supervisor-mmrm]). The β estimates for the intervention group compared to the placebo group were 2.3 at module two (post; p = 0.0073), 3.0 at module three (post; p = 0.0061), 3.2 at module four (post; p = 0.0022), 2.1 at module five (post; p = 0.068), and 3.6 at module six (post; p = 0.0038). The factor Additional treatment showed no significant effect (β = 1.0; p = 0.26), and Type of supervision similarly revealed no significant association (β = 1.6; p = 0.15). No significant effect was observed for Offense type (hands‑on vs. hands‑off) (β = −1.2; p = 0.20). Static recidivism risk (baseline) showed a non‑significant negative association (β = −0.66; p = 0.086). A strong and highly significant positive association was found for baseline WAI‑SR scores (β = 0.70; p < 0.0001). Regarding timepoint, none of the modules showed significant differences compared to module two (post; all p‑values ≥ 0.059).
Pairwise pre–post comparisons for the WAI‑SR total score (supervisor) revealed a statistically significant increase within the intervention arm at module two (post; M = 43 ± 9 SD to M = 46 ± 8 SD; p < 0.0001, q < 0.0001). A smaller, nominally significant increase was also observed at module six (post; M = 49 ± 9 SD to M = 50 ± 8 SD; p = 0.046, q = 0.18), which did not survive adjustment for multiple comparisons. No other modules in the intervention group showed statistically significant pre–post changes (all q-values ≥ 0.35). In contrast, the placebo arm demonstrated no statistically significant pre–post changes in WAI‑SR scores for any module (all q-values > 0.99; see [@tbl-anc-wai-sv-pre-post-pairwise-intervention] and [@tbl-anc-wai-sv-pre-post-pairwise-placebo]). This pattern of results is consistent with the significant timepoint × treatment interaction effects detected in the MMRM analysis, indicating that improvements in the supervisor-rated working alliance occurred selectively in the intervention group, particularly at module two, with a smaller, non‑robust change at module six.
Exploratory analysis of difference scores for the WAI‑SR total score (supervisor) between treatment groups revealed one statistically significant effect (see [@tbl-anc-wai-sv-diffscore]). The change from module one (pre) to module two (post) was higher in the intervention arm (median = 4 [Q1 = −1, Q3 = 6]) compared to the placebo arm (median = 1 [Q1 = −3, Q3 = 4]; p = 0.0090, q = 0.045), indicating a greater early improvement in the supervisor‑rated working alliance among participants receiving the intervention. A further difference score — from module five (post) to module six (post) — showed a statistical trend, with higher scores in the intervention group (median = 1 [Q1 = 0, Q3 = 4]) compared to the placebo group (median = 0 [Q1 = −2, Q3 = 2]; p = 0.061, q = 0.24), suggesting a potential late‑stage improvement, although this effect did not survive adjustment. All other difference scores (modules two to five) showed no meaningful group differences (all q-values ≥ 0.40). This pattern is consistent with the MMRM and pairwise comparison results, underscoring that notable improvements in supervisor‑rated working alliance were observed primarily in the intervention arm at module two, with a possible but non‑robust gain at module six.
