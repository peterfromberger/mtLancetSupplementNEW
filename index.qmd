### Description of the WBI

The content of the intervention arm focused exclusively on psychological meaningful risk factors [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023]. Already established therapeutic concepts from in-face community-based treatment programs for individuals who committed sexual offenses against children [@brikenPraeventionSexuellenKindesmissbrauchs2017; @wildPreventionSexualChild2020] as well as cognitive-behavioral treatment concepts [see @frombergerMyTabuAPlaceboControlled2021 for more details] have been adapted for online use. Both programs have been designed for CSA as well as CSAM offenders. Parts relevant to the meaningful risk factors of both in-face programs have been digitalized and parts on risk factors not supported by empirical evidence have been skipped in order to shorten the HBI. Virtual participants ccompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor). All modules within the intervention arm comprised techniques of motivational interviewing [@rollnickMotivationalInterviewingTreatment2015] to enhance or maintain the motivation of the participants. The WBI is designed for female as well as male participants, but due to a lack of knowledge with regard to specific risk factors for female sex offenders at development of the HBI, the content remains identical for women and men. In order to make the HBI suitable for female participants, the used language was adapted and one female virtual participant has been designed and integrated.
