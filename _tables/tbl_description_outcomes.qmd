    "The SSQ-P is a self developed online questionnaire asking the participants about their demographics, lifestyle, current and former therapeutic treatments and offending history.",
    "The SSQ-SO is an online questionnaire for the SO concerning the current living condition, offending and clinical history, and index offense of the participant.",
    "The SSQ-CF is a checklist for coding court files. Information from the court files is coded with the SSQ-CF by the study investigators to determine whether the participant meets the study inclusion criteria. This includes information on the probation period, index offense, and former offenses. In case that items of the SSQ-CF cannot be filled out adequately by utilizing court files, the participants was interviewed directly.",
    "The PHQ-D [@graefeScreeningPsychischerStoerungen2004] is a screening tool for mental disorders. Classification of results generally takes place on a syndrome level. Syndromes examined are: Somatoform disorders, major depressive syndrome, other depressive syndrome, panic syndrome, other anxiety syndromes, eating disorder syndrome, alcohol abuse. Tests are scored using a stencil. Utilizing a sum score for each syndrome, conclusions pertaining to the severity of each syndrome can be drawn. The measure shows good to very good diagnostic validity, especially regarding panic disorder and major depression (45).",
    "The SSQ-rSO is an online questionnaire asking the SO frequently about the participant’s conduct during probation period.",
    "The SSPI-2 [@setoRevisedScreeningScale2017a] is a structured rating scale of assessing pedophilic interests based on the offending behavior. It comprises five items (number, age, gender, relationship of victims, and child pornography) and is significantly associated with phallometrically assessed sexual arousal to children. The SSPI-2 is derived from information of the participants as well as the SO.",
    "The ICD-11-Sexuality-Screener [@screenerInstituteSexResearch2019] is a self-assessment procedure to ascertain indications for the presence of sexual dysfunction, gender dysphoria, or paraphilic disorder. However, the instrument is not suitable for diagnosis. It is assumed that the ICD-11-Sexuality-Screener can identify individuals who have the disorders described above. The ICD-11-Screener is not validated yet.",
    "The CARES is a composite instrument integrating the CARES-A, which assesses acute dynamic risk factors, and the CARES-S, which measures stable dynamic risk factors [@sonjaetzlerDevelopmentInitialValidationsubmitted]. The CARES total score is calculated by summing the CARES-A and CARES-S total scores, producing a range from 0 to 102, with higher scores indicating greater severity of both acute and stable dynamic risk factors.\nThe CARES-A scale evaluates seven acute dynamic risk factors associated with sexual reoffending in individuals convicted of at least one (contact or non-contact) sexual offense against children: (1) Preoccupation with Potential Victims, (2) Hostility, (3) Hypersexuality, (4) Rejection of Control Measures, (5) Emotional Crisis, (6) Loss of Social Support, and (7) Substance Use. Comprising 21 items, the CARES-A yields scores from 0 to 42; higher scores denote more pronounced acute dynamic risk. Reliability coefficients for the CARES-A range from α = .79 to α = .83. Analyses of social desirability revealed no significant correlations between CARES-A scores and either the Exaggeration of Positive Qualities or Negative Qualities [@sonjaetzlerDevelopmentInitialValidationsubmitted].\nThe CARES-S scale assesses six stable dynamic predictors of sexual recidivism. It consists of 30 items covering: (1) Problematic Sexual Interests, (2) Problematic Emotion-Regulation, (3) Lack of Problem-Solving Skills, (4) Offense-Supportive Cognitions, and (5) Lack of Social Support. Five of these subscales correspond to empirically supported psychological risk factors for sexual recidivism [@mannAssessingRiskSexual2010; @setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023]. The CARES-S total score ranges from 0 to 60; higher scores indicate stronger stable dynamic risk factors. The reduced CARES-S achieved an internal consistency of α = .53. As with the CARES-A, no significant correlations with social desirability measures were found in the evaluation study [@sonjaetzlerDevelopmentInitialValidationsubmitted].",
    "Officially registered re-offenses will be assessed five years after last-patient-out (September 2030).",
    "The Corrections Victoria Treatment Readiness Questionnaire [CVTRQ; (91)] is a self-report measure designed to assess treatment readiness in offenders who have been referred to a cognitive skills program. It comprises 20 items and consists of four scales: (1) Attitudes and motivation, (2) emotional reaction, (3) offending beliefs, and (4) efficacy. Each item has to be answered on a five-point Likert-scale. The CVTRQ shows an acceptable convergent validity, discriminant validity as well as predictive validity (91). To the best of our knowledge, there is no validated German version of the CVTRQ. @myTabu translated the CVTRQ. The translation was checked and translated back into English. Resulting differences due to adaptation were inspected and discussed in terms of item content.",
    "The RCQ [@rollnickDevelopmentShortReadiness1992] is a 12 item questionnaire originally designed to identify the stage of change reached by individuals who excessively drink alcohol. The German version (RCQ-D)[@hannoverReadinessChangeQuestionnaire2002] was adapted within the project by changing the questions regarding drinking of alcohol in questions regarding CSA and CSEM offenses. Responses are made on a five-point Likert-scale. The RCQ-D as well as the RCQ shows good psychometric properties [@hannoverReadinessChangeQuestionnaire2002]. Psychometric properties of the version adapted for ISAC and ICCSEM are not available yet.",
    "The QMPR [@merzQuestionnaireMeasurementPsychological1983] is a questionnaire for the assessment of psychological reactance defined as the theory that people resist attempts to constrain either their thoughts or their behaviors.

    "The ATQ is based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) which defines acceptance as behavioral intention of using a certain technology. According to the model, predictors of this intention are performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence. Predictors of actual technology usage are facilitating conditions, such as organizational or technical preconditions [@venkateshUserAcceptanceInformation2003]. The ATQ comprises items which measure acceptance and the previously named predictors from the UTAUT model as well as additional items concerning following extended predictors: internet anxiety, attitude toward using technology, planning, and importance of monetary compensation. The items of the ATQ were either self-constructed or derived from questionnaires used in former studies and adapted if conceptually required [@zarskiTurningGoodIntentions2018; @apolinario-hagenDeterminantFactorsPublic2019; @baumeisterImpactAcceptanceFacilitating2015]. Internal consistency (Cronbach’s α) of the original scale ranges from 0.68 to 0.92.
