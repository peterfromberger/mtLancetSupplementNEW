<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Randomized Controlled Add-on Trial of Fluoxetine and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Help-Seeking Men with a Sexual Interest in Children: Presentation of the PARACHUTES Trial Protocol and Initial Feasibility Data;,citation_abstract=Background Sexual Interest in Children (SIC) is a major risk factor for sexual offending, yet clinical trials are sparse. The present protocol outlines a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that aims to investigate the effectiveness of fluoxetine and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in help-seeking men with SIC. Methods Adult men contacting the Swedish telephone helpline PrevenTell are screened for inclusion and invited to further assessment on site. One hundred and eleven men with SIC (defined as DSM-5 pedophilic disorder or hebephilia) will be randomized (1:1:1 ratio) to receive one of three interventions for 14 weeks: (1) an internet-administered psychoeducational program (iPP), (2) iPP and the addition of fluoxetine 20-40 mg or (3) iPP and the addition of internet-administered CBT (iCBT). Exclusion criteria include severe psychiatric illness, contraindicating treatment and an elevated risk of committing hands-on sexual offences. Symptom intensity is assessed at baseline, pre-treatment, every other week for 12 weeks, and post treatment. The primary outcome measure is the Sexual Interest in Children: Current Assessment Scale (SIC: CAS) that quantifies sexual behaviors associated with SIC as well as perceived distress and impairment. Secondary outcomes include measures of dynamic risk-factors for committing sexual offences. Results The data collected during the initial 20 months of recruitment were analyzed to predict the required number of individuals to be screened and estimate the probable length of the data collection phase. As of March 2022 to November 2023, 146 men have called PrevenTell and disclosed a sexual interest in minors. Following pre-screening, 110 men were excluded from participation in the trial. Current SSRI therapy was the primary reason for exclusion (n = 24; 22%), followed by an elevated risk of committing hands-on sexual offences (n = 14; 13%). Among the 31 men who underwent the screening procedure on site, 26 were allocated to either iPP, iPP+fluoxetine, or iPP+iCBT. The recruitment rate indicates that the trial will be concluded within the pre-estimated timeframe. Discussion This is the first RCT of treatment with SSRI and iCBT in a population of help-seeking men with SIC. The significance of this trial and its methodological strengths and limitations are discussed.;,citation_author=Roberth Adebahr;,citation_author=Katarina Görts Öberg;,citation_author=Christoffer Rahm;,citation_author=Markus Byström;,citation_author=Charlotte Sparre;,citation_author=Adrian E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What Kind of Therapy Works With Juveniles Who Have Sexually Offended? A Randomized-Controlled Trial of Two Versions of a Specialized Cognitive Behavioral Outpatient Treatment Program;,citation_abstract=There is ongoing debate about whether specialized treatment is effective to reduce sexual recidivism in juveniles who have sexually offended (JSOs). Although most treatment programs are based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles for preventing sexual offending, accordant scientific evidence is poor. Following CONSORT guidelines, the present study aimed to evaluate two versions of a short-term outpatient treatment program for JSOs in Switzerland: (a) the Therapy Program for Adequate Sexual Behaviors Version 1 (ThePaS-I), which included offending-specific skills training; (b) the ThePaS-II, which included general socioemotional skills training. Based on changes in self-reported mental health, sexual behaviors, victim empathy, and therapist-rated risk, as well as comprehensive data on sexual and general recidivism, we found some similarities regarding the effects of the two treatments. ThePaS-II showed better short-term changes in self-reported mental health than the ThePaS-I. However, JSOs in the ThePaS-I showed lower rates of sexual reoffending (but not general reoffending) after treatment than those in the ThePaS-II. Despite some methodological limitations, the current findings favor offending-specific skills-based therapy over general skills-based ones for preventing sexual reoffenses. The findings may encourage further methodologically sound studies to examine different treatment approaches for juveniles and adults who have committed criminal offenses.;,citation_author=Marcel Aebi;,citation_author=Chiara Krause;,citation_author=Steffen Barra;,citation_author=Gunnar Vogt;,citation_author=Leonardo Vertone;,citation_author=Madleina Manetsch;,citation_author=Daniela Imbach;,citation_author=Jérôme Endrass;,citation_author=Astrid Rossegger;,citation_author=Klaus Schmeck;,citation_author=Cornelia Bessler;,citation_publication_date=2022-03;,citation_cover_date=2022-03;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.1177/10790632211070804;,citation_issn=1079-0632;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sexual Abuse;,citation_publisher=SAGE Publications Inc;">

Sixty-seven studies were identified from a comprehensive search of 56 years of research; 92 effect sizes were derived from these studies. The overall effect of clinical versus statistical prediction showed a somewhat greater accuracy for statistical methods. The most stringent sample of studies, from which 48 effect sizes were extracted, indicated a 13% increase in accuracy using statistical versus clinical methods. Several variables influenced this overall effect. Clinical and statistical prediction accuracy varied by type of prediction, the setting in which predictor data were gathered, the type of statistical formula used, and the amount of information available to the clinicians and the formulas. Recommendations are provided about when and under what conditions counseling psychologists might use statistical formulas as well as when they can rely on clinical methods.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On the Intricate Relationship between Sexual Motivation and Arousal;,citation_abstract=Sexual motivation and sexual arousal are widely used concepts. While there seem to be considerable agreement as to the meaning of sexual motivation, there is certain confusion about the exact meaning of sexual arousal. Some use it as a synonym to sexual motivation and others make it equivalent to erection or vaginal lubrication. An unresolved question is the relationship between sexual arousal and general arousal as well as that between arousal and motivation. I present arguments for the view that arousal refers to the general state of alertness of the organism. Consequently, there is no such thing as a specific sexual arousal. I suggest that this term should be abandoned, or if that is not feasible, to make it a synonym to enhanced genital blood flow. The notion of a subjective sexual arousal, some kind of vaguely described mental state, seems to lack all explanatory value. I then show that general arousal is an important determinant of sexual motivation, and that the execution of copulatory acts leads to increased general arousal. This increase leads to enhanced sexual motivation, making the activation of sexual reflexes requiring high levels of motivation possible. Examples of such reflexes may be ejaculation in males of many species, and perhaps the psychic state of orgasm in women.;,citation_author=Anders Ågmo;,citation_publication_date=2011-05;,citation_cover_date=2011-05;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2010.08.013;,citation_issn=0018506X;,citation_volume=59;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Hormones and Behavior;">

Findings reveal different profiles of escalation crossover from child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) offending, online solicitation (OS) offending, and commercial offending. Risk factors and characteristics of CSEM escalation crossover offenders included age, prior criminal history, sexual inclination toward children, cognitive distortions, severity, extremity, and frequency of CSEM engagement, communicating or attempting to communicate with children, and networking with other CSEM offenders. Risk factors and characteristics of OS escalation crossover offenders included race, age, marital/relationship status, employment status, education level, sexual inclination toward children, cognitive distortions, psychiatric disorders, and prior criminal history. Risk factors and characteristics of commercial escalation crossover offenders included race, age, employment status, marital/relationship status, and denying a history of contact offending. Behavioral themes were also identified for OS and commercial escalation crossover offenders.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evidence for Heritability of Adult Men’s Sexual Interest in Youth under Age 16 from a Population-Based Extended Twin Design;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Sexual interest in children resembles sexual gender orientation in terms of early onset and stability across the life span. Although a genetic component to sexual interest in children seems possible, no research has addressed this question to date. Prior research showing familial transmission of pedophilia remains inconclusive about shared environmental or genetic factors. Studies from the domains of sexual orientation and sexually problematic behavior among children pointed toward genetic components. Adult men’s sexual interest in youthfulnessrelated cues may be genetically influenced. Aim. The aim of the present study was to test whether male sexual interest in children and youth under age 16 involves a heritable component. Main Outcome Measures. The main outcome measure was responses in a confidential survey concerning sexual interest, fantasies, or activity pertaining to children under the age of 16 years during the previous 12 months. Methods. The present study used an extended family design within behavioral genetic modeling to estimate the contributions of genetic and environmental factors in the occurrence of adult men’s sexual interest in children and youth under age 16. Participants were male twins and their male siblings from a population-based Finnish cohort sample aged 21–43 years (N = 3,967). Results. The incidence of sexual interest in children under age was 3%. Twin correlations were higher for monozygotic than for dizygotic twins. Behavioral genetic model fitting indicated that a model including genetic effects as well as nonshared environmental influences (including measurement error), but not common environmental influences, fits the data best. The amount of variance attributable to nonadditive genetic influences (heritability) was estimated at 14.6%. Conclusions. The present study provides the first indication that genetic influences may play a role in shaping sexual interest toward children and adolescents among adult men. Compared with the variance attributable to nonshared environmental effects (plus measurement error), the contribution of any genetic factors seems comparatively weak. Future research should address the possible interplay of genetic with environmental risk factors, such as own sexual victimization in childhood. Alanko K, Salo B, Mokros A, and Santtila P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex Differences in Adults’ Relative Visual Interest in Female and Male Faces, Toys, and Play Styles;,citation_abstract=An individual’s reproductive potential appears to influence response to attractive faces of the opposite sex. Otherwise, relatively little is known about the characteristics of the adult observer that may influence his or her affective evaluation of male and female faces. An untested hypothesis (based on the proposed role of attractive faces in mate selection) is that most women would show greater interest in male faces whereas most men would show greater interest in female faces. Further, evidence from individuals with preferences for same-sex sexual partners suggests that response to attractive male and female faces may be influenced by gender-linked play preferences. To test these hypotheses, visual attention directed to sex-linked stimuli (faces, toys, play styles) was measured in 39 men and 44 women using eye tracking technology. Consistent with our predictions, men directed greater visual attention to all male-typical stimuli and visual attention to male and female faces was associated with visual attention to gender conforming or nonconforming stimuli in a manner consistent with previous research on sexual orientation. In contrast, women showed a visual preference for female-typical toys, but no visual preference for male faces or female-typical play styles. These findings indicate that sex differences in visual processing extend beyond stimuli associated with adult sexual behavior. We speculate that sex differences in visual processing are a component of the expression of gender phenotypes across the lifespan that may reflect sex differences in the motivational properties of gender-linked stimuli.;,citation_author=Gerianne M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Role of Presence in the Level of Anxiety Experienced in Clinical Virtual Environments;,citation_abstract=Recent reviews point towards that Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) can be an effective medium to provide exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. The concept of presence, usually defined as the sense of being inside the virtual environment, has been considered the principal mechanism that leads to the experience of anxiety in clinical virtual environments. The present study sought to examine the relationship between sense of presence and in-session anxiety in a sample of 210 students showing high and low test anxiety when exposed to both clinical and non-stressful virtual environments. This is the largest study conducted to date with the aim of examining the relationship between presence and anxiety in clinical virtual environments, and the first to explore separately the relationship between presence and state-anxiety in phobic and non-phobic participants. The results suggest that presence was not related to anxiety in a non-stressful environment. It was also found that although presence is related to anxiety in both groups of students when exposed to clinical virtual environments, this relationship was clearly stronger for high test anxiety students.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Viewing Reaction Time as a Diagnostic Tool of Pedohebephilia in the Dunkelfeld;,citation_abstract=Diagnosing pedohebephilia is fraught with obstacles given the tabooed nature of this sexual preference. The viewing reaction time effect (VRT) provides a non-intrusive indirect measure of sexual interest in minors. In forensic populations, the ability of the difference between the latencies while viewing child and adult sexual stimuli (VRT index) to discern child sexual offenders from a range of control groups has been ascertained meta-analytically. Given that the effect has been studied almost exclusively in forensic samples, its dependence or independence on prior overt (deviant) sexual behavior remains unclear. The present study sought to examine the relationship of prior sexual and non-sexual behaviors with the VRT in a sample of 282 self-referring, help-seeking men with and without pedohebephilia with and without a history of prior child sexual offenses (CSO) or a use of child sexual abuse materials (CSAM) recruited outside a forensic context. We found that (1) the clinical diagnosis of pedohebephilia but not prior CSO or CSAM showed a significant association with the VRT index; (2) the discriminatory ability of the VRT index did not differ significantly between samples with and without a history of prior overt sexual behavior with children; (3) the VRT index correlated positively with a behavioral marker of pedohebephilia in a subsample of individuals with prior judicially detected or undetected overt sexual behavior with children; and (4) in the same subsample, the VRT index correlated positively with markers of sexual interests in minors or hypersexuality but not of antisociality. Equivalence testing failed to refute a potential effect of prior sexual behavior on the VRT index. Our study showed that the VRT may provide an unintrusive diagnostic tool for pedohebephilia.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Flow of Affective Information between Communicating Brains;,citation_abstract=When people interact, affective information is transmitted between their brains. Modern imaging techniques permit to investigate the dynamics of this brain-to-brain transfer of information. Here, we used informationbased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the flow of affective information between the brains of senders and perceivers engaged in ongoing facial communication of affect. We found that the level of neural activity within a distributed network of the perceiver’s brain can be successfully predicted from the neural activity in the same network in the sender’s brain, depending on the affect that is currently being communicated. Furthermore, there was a temporal succession in the flow of affective information from the sender’s brain to the perceiver’s brain, with information in the perceiver’s brain being significantly delayed relative to information in the sender’s brain. This delay decreased over time, possibly reflecting some “tuning in” of the perceiver with the sender. Our data support current theories of intersubjectivity by providing direct evidence that during ongoing facial communication a “shared space” of affect is successively built up between senders and perceivers of affective facial signals.;,citation_author=Silke Anders;,citation_author=Jakob Heinzle;,citation_author=Nikolaus Weiskopf;,citation_author=Thomas Ethofer;,citation_author=John-Dylan Haynes;,citation_publication_date=2011-01;,citation_cover_date=2011-01;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.07.004;,citation_issn=10538119;,citation_volume=54;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=NeuroImage;">

The RNR model underlies some of the most widely used risk-needs offender assessment instruments, and it is the only theoretical model that has been used to interpret the offender treatment literature. Recently, the good lives model (GLM) has been promoted as an alternative and enhancement to RNR. GLM sets itself apart from RNR by its positive, strengths-based, and restorative model of rehabilitation. In addition, GLM hypothesizes that enhancing personal fulfillment will lead naturally to reductions in criminogenic needs, whereas RNR posits the reverse direction. In this article the authors respond to GLM’s criticisms of RNR and conclude that little substance is added by GLM that is not already included in RNR, although proponents of RNR may learn from the popular appeal that GLM, with its positive, strength-based focus, has garnered from clinicians over the past decade.;,citation_author=D.

Sexual arousal and challenges involving young males would raise testosterone levels further. In turn, this would facilitate direct competitive behavior, including aggression. When males are required to care for offspring, testosterone levels will decrease. Testosterone levels will also be associated with different behavioral profiles among men, associated with life history strategies involving emphasis on either mating or parental effort.

Rapists and child molesters in the current sample endorsed markedly fewer cognitive distortions than the sexual offenders in Bumby’s original study (K. M. Bumby, 1996).

Uniform HIPAA protection does not apply to personal health data that are shared with apps in many contexts which creates a number of clinically relevant privacy and security concerns. Clinicians should also consider several relatively novel potential adverse clinical outcomes and liability concerns that may be relevant to specific categories of apps, including apps that target (i) medication adherence, (ii) collection of self-reported data, (iii) collection of passive data, and (iv) generation of treatment recommendations for psychotherapeutic and behavioral interventions.

To this end, the Virtual Reality Functional Capacity Assessment Tool (VRFCAT) was developed as a direct performance-based assessment of functional capacity that is sensitive to changes in function across multiple populations. Using a realistic virtual reality environment, the VRFCAT assesses a subject’s ability to complete instrumental activities associated with a shopping trip. The present investigation represents an initial evaluation of the VRFCAT as a potential co-primary measure of functional capacity in healthy aging and preclinical MCI/AD by examining test-retest reliability and associations with cognitive performance in healthy young and older adults. The VRFCAT was compared and contrasted with the UPSA-2-VIM, a traditional performance-based assessment utilizing physical props. Results demonstrated strong age-related differences in performance on each VRFCAT outcome measure, including total completion time, total errors, and total forced progressions. VRFCAT performance showed strong correlations with cognitive performance across both age groups. VRFCAT Total Time demonstrated good test-retest reliability (ICC=.80 in young adults; ICC=.64 in older adults) and insignificant practice effects, indicating the measure is suitable for repeated testing in healthy populations.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Behavior Believability in Virtual Worlds: Agents Acting When They Need To;,citation_abstract=Believability has been a perennial goal for the intelligent virtual agent community. One important aspect of believability largely consists in demonstrating autonomous behavior, consistent with the agent’s personality and motivational state, as well as the world conditions. Autonomy, on behalf of the agent, implies the existence of an internal structure and mechanism that allows the agent to have its own needs and interests, based on which the agent will dynamically select and generate goals that will in turn lead to self-determined behavior. Intrinsic motivation allows the agent to function and demonstrate behavior, even when no external stimulus is present, due to the constant change of its internal emotional and physiological state. The concept of motivation has already been investigated by research works on intelligent agents, trying to achieve autonomy. The current work presents an architecture and model to represent and manage internal driving factors in intelligent virtual agents, using the concept of motivations. Based on Maslow and Alderfer’s bio-psychological needs theories, we present a motivational approach to represent human needs and produce emergent behavior through motivation synthesis. Particular attention is given to basic, physiological level needs, which are the basis of behavior and can produce tendency to action even when there is no other interaction with the environment.;,citation_author=Nikos Avradinis;,citation_author=Themis Panayiotopoulos;,citation_author=George Anastassakis;,citation_publication_date=2013-05;,citation_cover_date=2013-05;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/2193-1801-2-246;,citation_issn=2193-1801;,citation_pmid=23853745;,citation_volume=2;,citation_journal_title=SpringerPlus;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Child Sexual Exploitation Materials Offenders: A Review;,citation_abstract=The downloading and possession of Child Sexual Exploitation Materials (CSEM; also referred to as child pornography and indecent images of children) is a commonly convicted type of Internet sexual offenses. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on CSEM offenders. We first provide a summary of the key motivations of CSEM offenders, characteristics of CSEM offenders compared to contact sexual offenders against children, and important facilitative factors. We then review the factors related to recidivism among CSEM offenders. Finally, we describe current developments in the risk assessment, police case prioritization, and treatment approaches for CSEM offenders. Generally, CSEM offenders hold a sexual interest in children, are low on antisocial tendencies, and pose a low risk to reoffend (including contact sexual offending). Key facilitative factors for CSEM offending include access to children, offense-supportive cognitions, and sexual arousal. Factors indicative of antisocial tendencies (e.g., criminal history) are associated with an increased risk of reoffending. Lastly, we address atypical sexual interest, socio-affective dysfunctions, and strategies for maintaining an offense-free lifestyle as key treatment targets for CSEM offenders. Lower treatment dosage, however, should be considered given CSEM-exclusive offenders’ lower risk level for contact sexual offenses. We hope that this review will inspire others to explore the current research gaps in future studies.;,citation_author=Kelly M. Babchishin;,citation_author=Hannah L. Merdian;,citation_author=Ross M.

Although the observed changes between the two conditions (i.e., Normal and Suppression) were small to moderate in magnitude, the change was not more than what would be expected by measurement error for most participants (e.g., 83% of pedophilic sex offenders against children did not successfully inhibit their sexual arousal in the Suppression condition). There were very few variables that were associated with the ability to suppress. Higher PedophiliaIndex scores in the Suppression condition predicted a greater likelihood of sexual recidivism among sex offenders (hazard ratio = 1.17, 95% CI [1.04, 1.32]), but the ability to suppress sexual arousal was not found to predict sexual recidivism. The current study highlights the importance of accounting for measurement error and found that, when doing so, most sex offenders against children are unable to successfully inhibit their sexual arousal to children when instructed to do so, and that the ability to suppress sexual arousal is not associated with recidivism.;,citation_author=Kelly M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Monitoring Changes in Risk of Reoffending: A Prospective Study of 632 Men on Community Supervision;,citation_abstract=Objectives: Few studies have examined how much individuals change on intermediate targets of risk to reoffend. Even fewer studies have examined the extent to which change on such measures predict reoffending. Establishing the validity of intermediate measures requires a multistep approach that (a) assesses the reliability of the change, (b) assesses change using statistical analyses that can account for measurement error, and (c) examines the extent to which change on these intermediate measures predict reoffending. Method: The current study examined the validity of an intermediate measure of risk to reoffend scored by community supervision officers (i.e., ACUTE-2007) in a large sample of men convicted of sexually motivated offenses (N = 632). Results: We found that risk to reoffend changes across time, the pattern of change varies across individuals, risk levels can predict different patterns of change, and that the best predictors of recidivism are the latest score or a rolling average of scores. Conclusions: Community supervision can use recent information concerning the community adjustment of their clients to predict recidivism. Best practice includes updating assessments and adjusting supervision practices based on their clients’ most recent assessment, or the average of previous assessments.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Multimodal Examination of Sexual Interest in Children: A Comparison of Sex Offenders and Non-Sex Offenders;,citation_abstract=Research and theoretical models have consistently identified sexual interest in children as a key factor involved in child sexual offending. However, there is only moderate agreement in the diagnosis of pedophilia and different assessment methods identify different offenders as pedophiles. The current study examined the discriminative and convergent validity of three different measures of sexual interest in children. Participants included sex offenders and nonsex offenders recruited from federal prisons (i.e., offenders serving sentences of more than 2 years) in Ontario, Canada. Child molesters’ responses (n = 35) were not significantly different from nonsex offenders (n = 21) on an implicit measure of sexual interest in children (Sexual Attraction to Children Implicit Association Test [SAC-IAT] d = 0.44, 95% CI [-0.11, 0.99]), but differed on the self-report (Sexual Interest Profiling System; d = 0.83, 95% CI [0.27, 1.39]) and viewing time (d = 1.15, 95% CI [0.54, 1.75]) measures. Findings did not provide clear support for the superiority of a multimodal approach, possibly due to the relatively small sample.

Based on 30 unique samples (comparison ns ranging from 98 to 2,702), the meta-analysis found key differences between groups. Offenders who committed contact sex offences were more likely to have access to children than those with only child pornography offences. In contrast, offenders who used the internet to commit sexual offences had greater access to the internet than those with contact sex offenders. Differences between the groups, however, were not limited to differential opportunities. Sex offenders against children and mixed offenders were found to score higher on indicators of antisociality than online child pornography offenders (CPOs). CPOs were also more likely to have psychological barriers to sexual offending than sex offenders against children and mixed offenders (e.g., greater victim empathy). Mixed offenders were found to be the most pedophilic, even more than CPOs. The findings suggest that offenders who restricted their offending behavior to online child pornography offences were different from mixed offenders and offline sex offenders against children, and that mixed offenders were a particularly high risk group.;,citation_author=Kelly M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Parental and Perinatal Risk Factors for Sexual Offending in Men: A Nationwide Case-Control Study;,citation_abstract=Background. Prior studies suggest parental and perinatal risk factors are associated with later offending. It remains uncertain, however, if such risk factors are similarly related to sexual offending. Method. We linked socio-demographic, family relations, and perinatal (obtained at birth) data from the nationwide Swedish registers from 1973 to 2009 with information on criminal convictions of cases and control subjects. Male sex offenders (n = 13 773) were matched 1:5 on birth year and county of birth in Sweden to male controls without sexual or non-sexual violent convictions. To examine risk-factor specificity for sexual offending, we also compared male violent, non-sexual offenders (n = 135 953) to controls without sexual or non-sexual violent convictions. Predictors included parental (young maternal or paternal age at son’s birth, educational attainment, violent crime, psychiatric disorder, substance misuse, suicide attempt) and perinatal (number of older brothers, low Apgar score, low birth weight, being small for gestational age, congenital malformations, small head size) variables. Results. Conditional logistic regression models found consistent patterns of statistically significant, small to moderate independent associations of parental risk factors with sons’ sexual offending and non-sexual violent offending. For perinatal risk factors, patterns varied more; small for gestational age and small head size exhibited similar risk effects for both offence types whereas a higher number of older biological brothers and any congenital malformation were small, independent risk factors only for non-sexual violence. Conclusions. This nationwide study suggests substantial commonalities in parental and perinatal risk factors for the onset of sexual and non-sexual violent offending.;,citation_author=K. M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Time-Series Analysis for Rapid Event-Related Skin Conductance Responses;,citation_abstract=Event-related skin conductance responses (SCRs) are traditionally analysed by comparing the amplitude of individual peaks against a pre-stimulus baseline. Many experimental manipulations in cognitive neuroscience dictate paradigms with short inter trial intervals, precluding accurate baseline estimation for SCR measurements. Here, we present a novel and general approach to SCR analysis, derived from methods used in neuroimaging that estimate responses using a linear convolution model. In effect, the method obviates peak-scoring and makes use of the full SCR. We demonstrate, across three experiments, that the method has face validity in analysing reactions to a loud white noise and emotional pictures, can be generalised to paradigms where the shape of the response function is unknown and can account for parametric trial-by-trial effects. We suggest our approach provides greater flexibility in analysing SCRs than existing methods.;,citation_author=Dominik R. Bach;,citation_author=Guillaume Flandin;,citation_author=Karl J.

Primary data consisted of responses to the 11-item Paraphilic Interests Scale. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, the scale mean was similar for paraphilic and control samples. Using logistic regression and the same items, we derived three highly correlated measures that robustly discriminated paraphilic and control samples (ds ranging from 0.86 to 0.92). These successful measures capitalized on the unanticipated fact that some items (especially those assessing transvestism and masochistic humiliation) were positively associated with membership in paraphilic samples, while others (especially those assessing voyeurism) were negatively associated with such membership. Subsequent analyses focused on one of the measures, the Paraphilic Interests Scale Contrast (PISC). Consistent with prior findings distinguishing paraphilias and homosexual orientation, PISC was not elevated among homosexual males compared with heterosexual males among the control groups. Within four paraphilic samples, PISC was positively associated with additional paraphilic phenomena.

It is therefore sensitive to self-assessments in domains relevant to relational desirability. Positive relationships between self-perceived physical attractiveness and self-esteem found in previous studies may reflect the functioning of a mating sociometer, designed to monitor individuals’ desirability as romantic or sexual partners. We thus predicted that these relationships should be mediated by self-perceptions of romantic desirability, or more specifically, individuals’ confidence in their abilities to successfully establish and maintain romantic relationships. Two hundred and eighty seven young adults (98 male) completed an online measure of self-perceived attractiveness, together with measures of self-confidence in appearance and romantic relationships, body-esteem and global self-esteem. Linear regression analyses indicated that self-perceived attractiveness, self-confidence in appearance and body-esteem all significantly predicted self-esteem, and that in each case, the relationship was mediated by romantic self-confidence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Endocrinology of Sexual Arousal;,citation_abstract=The relevance of testosterone, oestradiol and certain peptides (oxytocin (OT), $\beta$-endorphin and prolactin (PRL)) to sexual arousal in humans is reviewed. In addition to behavioural studies, evidence of distribution of gonadal steroid receptors in the brain and the limited evidence from brain imaging are also considered. Testosterone plays a key role in the adult male, with clear, consistent evidence from studies of hypogonadal and eugonadal men. The roles of testosterone in the development of sexual arousability, and in the aging male, are less clear. The relevance of aromatization and of non-sexual effects of testosterone which might indirectly influence sexual arousal are not well understood. Testosterone in the female presents a more complex, less consistent picture. One possible explanation is a much greater variability across women in responsiveness to testosterone. A “desensitization hypothesis” to account for the striking gender differences is offered. There is limited evidence of a direct effect of oestradiol on sexual arousability in women. The extent to which testosterone in women acts by conversion to oestradiol or by increase of free oestradiol is not yet clear. The role of peptides in sexual arousal remains uncertain, partly because of the multiple roles and sites of action of most peptides. OT and $\beta$-endorphin appear to have both excitatory and inhibitory effects. PRL has been proposed as an inhibitory factor via direct inhibition of dopaminergic activity, but the evidence for this is inconclusive. Whereas the traditional concept of “hormone” continues to apply to the role of testosterone and oestradiol in sexual arousal, peptides present a more complex role.;,citation_author=J Bancroft;,citation_publication_date=2005-09;,citation_cover_date=2005-09;,citation_year=2005;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1677/joe.1.06233;,citation_issn=0022-0795, 1479-6805;,citation_volume=186;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Endocrinology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sense of Presence in Emotional Virtual Environments;,citation_abstract=Most definitions on presence have been based on cognitive or environmental aspects. However, we think that presence, like all human experiences, is influenced by emotions. EMMA project (IST-2001-39192) is aimed to study the nature of this relationship between emotions and presence. One of the main hypotheses proposed by EMMA is that emotions may enhance presence. In this line, the main objective of the present paper is to study the differences in presence between “emotional” environments and “neutral” environments. In order to achieve this objective, we have designed a Mood Induction Procedure using VR (VR-MIP, to induce different moods (sadness, joy, anxiety and relax) in experimental subjects. Our results point out that VR-MIPs are able to induce different moods in the users. Regarding the role of mood on the sense of presence, our results show differences between emotional and neutral environments in some presence measurements.;,citation_author=Rosa Baños;,citation_author=Cristina Botella;,citation_author=Víctor Liaño;,citation_author=Belén Guerrero;,citation_author=Beatriz Rey;,citation_author=Mariano Alcañiz;,citation_publication_date=2004;,citation_cover_date=2004;,citation_year=2004;,citation_language=en-US;">

In three studies the validity of the Aggressiveness-IAT (Agg-IAT) was supported by substantial correlations with self-report measures of aggressiveness. After controlling for self-report measures of aggressiveness, the Agg-IAT accounted for 9 to 15 percent of the variance of three different indicators of aggressive behavior across three studies. To further explore the nomological network around the Agg-IAT we investigated its correlations with measures of social desirability (SD). Although not fully conclusive, the results across four studies provided some support for a weak negative correlation between impression management SD and aggressive behavior as well as the Agg-IAT. This result is in line with an interpersonally oriented selfcontrol account of impression management SD. Individuals with high SD scores seem to behave less aggressively, and to show lower Agg-IAT scores.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Research Review: Attention Bias Modification (ABM): A Novel Treatment for Anxiety Disorders: Research Review: Attention Bias Modification (ABM);,citation_abstract=The evidence of clinically relevant effects of attention training in GAD and SP patients directly links the research on therapeutics and the research on attention bias. At the theoretical level, the extant attention training studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that modifying attentional biases toward threat causally reduces anxiety symptoms. At the practical level, these findings indicate that it may be possible to utilize attention training procedures clinically, either independently or as augmentation of already established treatments for anxiety. Despite its high prevalence, many individuals with anxiety disorders do not receive treatment. Additionally, many individuals who present for treatment respond poorly to it, do not respond at all, or drop out of treatment (Kendall &amp;amp;amp; Sugarman, 1997). Specifically for children and adolescents, computerbased training of attention may be more acceptable than traditional in-person therapy formats, and it may offer advantages by delivering systematic exposure to threat during which attention can be guided and controlled (Pine et al., 2009). Such computer-based attention retraining may act directly to reduce anxiety symptoms and could augment the core-CBT feature of systematic exposure to threats. With CBT, patients attempt to use cognitive control strategies to willfully alter their attentional focus (see also Wells et al., 1997). With computerized ABM, patients can implicitly learn to control attention in the absence of explicit instructions. Thus, combining CBT with ABM may simultaneously target explicit and implicit processes contributing to biased cognitive processes in anxiety. Finally, the computer-based nature of ABM bears the potential to enhance dissemination of treatment both in the clinic and remotely, over the internet or via installation of simple software packages (Chu et al., 2004; MacLeod, Soong, Rutherford, &amp; Campbell, 2007).;,citation_author=Yair Bar-Haim;,citation_publication_date=2010-05;,citation_cover_date=2010-05;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02251.x;,citation_issn=00219630, 14697610;,citation_volume=51;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Welches Potenzial haben virtuelle Realitäten in der klinischen und forensischen Psychiatrie? Ein Überblick über aktuelle Verfahren und Einsatzmöglichkeiten;,citation_abstract=Virtual reality (VR) applications have already been successfully used in the diagnostics and treatment of psychiatric disorders for 20 years. After approximately 5 years there are now the first examples of the application of VR in the context of forensic psychiatry. The most important advantage of VR for forensic applications is the possibility to develop realistic, safe and highly controllable virtual diagnostics and learning environments. In this way practitioners can treat or assess criminal offenders in scenarios that would otherwise be risky, unethical or ecologically invalid. This article presents various study examples of current applications of VR for clinical treatment and diagnosis of patients as well as examples for the prognosis and therapy of criminal offenders. This overview shows that VR can now also be a promising tool in forensic psychiatry, which can supplement or extend already established instruments. Applications of VR can also be helpful in the training of forensic psychiatric personnel, as can be seen in some promising results of training studies with virtual patients; however, before they can be implemented into routine professional life, extensive research is needed in this field. Before the introduction of VR applications in research and practice, not only the advantages but also the disadvantages of VR must be taken into consideration and special attention should be paid to the ethical guidelines, which have been developed for this purpose. The continuous development and the increasingly widespread use of VR in clinical and forensic psychiatry imply that VR also has the potential to become an established instrument in research and therapy.;,citation_author=Hermann Barbe;,citation_author=Bruno Siegel;,citation_author=Jürgen L.

The groups were compared on their level of psychometric change over treatment on individual measures, on measures grouped by dynamic risk domain, and on overall psychometric change, using a variety of analyses, including examination of clinically significant change. There were no differences in amount of change over treatment or, for those deemed as requiring change, clinically significant change, by program approach, for the majority of the measures examined. However, chi-square analyses indicated that there was an association between attending the GL version of the programs and sustaining a functional score across a number of measures of pro-offending attitudes and across measures of socioaffective functioning, posttreatment. In addition, achieving an overall “treated profile” on the psychometrics posttreatment was associated with attendance on the GL versions of the community programs, although the GL starters were less dysfunctional than the RP starters.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Random Effects Structure for Confirmatory Hypothesis Testing: Keep It Maximal;,citation_abstract=Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the “gold standard” for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.;,citation_author=Dale J.

We report on a meta-analysis of 30 non-overlapping samples (total N = 25,978), with 26 samples identifying CSEM index offenses and subsequent recidivism using official sources (e.g., charges) and four samples identifying CSEM offenses and subsequent recidivism using self-report. Individuals with CSEM offenses based on official sources showed a fixed-effect recidivism rate of 5.9 % any sexual (95 % CI = [5.6, 6.3], k [studies] = 21, N = 19,112), 1.5 % contact sexual (95 % CI = [1.4, 1.7], k = 20, N = 18,543), and 4.1 % CSEM (95 % CI = [3.8, 4.4], k = 21, N = 13,522), after an average of 5-year follow-up.

There were several other significant moderators: National sources of official recidivism data produced higher rates than local sources (Q$\Delta$ = 58.1, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .0001, df = 1); official recidivism had lower rates than self-reported recidivism (Q$\Delta$ = 232.2, p $&amp;lt;$ .0001, df = 1); longer follow-ups were associated with higher rates (unstandardized B = 0.01, Z = 75.8, p $<$ .001); and more recent studies showed higher rates, unstandardized (B = 0.002, Z = 68.0, p $<$ .001).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reducing Problematic Pornography Use with Imaginal Retraining-A Randomized Controlled Trial;,citation_abstract=Background and aim Problematic pornography use (PPU) can be a manifestation of compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD). Studies investigating PPU confirm approach-avoidance tendencies in response to pornographic stimuli in this population. This study show indications of the significance of the efficacy of imaginal retraining, a variant of approach bias modification, as an intervention for PPU. Methods A total of 274 participants (86.5% male; mean age = 30.65, SD = 10.13) with self-reported PPU were randomized to imaginal retraining (instruction video) or a waitlist control group. Assessments were conducted online at baseline and after the six-week intervention period. The primary outcome was a reduction in problematic pornography use. Compulsive sexual behavior, sexual desire, depressiveness, and satisfaction with the intervention served as secondary outcomes. Results Retention was low (51.7%), but comparable between groups. The retraining was performed at least once a week (the per-protocol [PP] criterion) by 51.4% of participants. The PP analyses of 111 participants showed a significant reduction in problematic pornography use (primary outcome) in the intervention compared to the control group. The intention-to-treat analyses (ITT), however, did not corroborate this result. Despite low adherence, participants rated their satisfaction with the intervention positively. Discussion and Conclusion Imaginal retraining can function as a low-threshold self-help intervention for PPU to overcome help-seeking barriers and may reduce PPU in a subgroup of users. Low adherence limits the results of this trial. Given the need for low-threshold interventions for PPU and/or CSBD, further research should focus on increasing adherence and should evaluate retraining for clinical groups.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The German Dunkelfeld Project: A Pilot Study to Prevent Child Sexual Abuse and the Use of Child Abusive Images;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Sexual interest toward prepubescents and pubescents (pedophilia and hebephilia) constitutes a major risk factor for child sexual abuse (CSA) and viewing of child abusive images, i.e., child pornography offenses (CPO). Most child sexual exploitation involving CSA and CPO are undetected and unprosecuted in the “Dunkelfeld” (German: “dark field”). Aim. This study assesses a treatment program to enhance behavioral control and reduce associated dynamic risk factors (DRF) in self-motivated pedophiles/hebephiles in the Dunkelfeld. Methods. Between 2005 and 2011, 319 undetected help-seeking pedophiles and hebephiles expressed interest in taking part in an anonymous and confidential 1-year-treatment program using broad cognitive behavioral methodology in the Prevention Project Dunkelfeld. Therapy was assessed using nonrandomized waiting list control design (n = 53 treated group [TG]; n = 22 untreated control group [CG]). Main Outcome Measures. Self-reported pre-/posttreatment DRF changes were assessed and compared with CG. Offending behavior characteristics were also assessed via self-reporting. Results. No pre-/postassessment changes occurred in the control group. Emotional deficits and offense-supportive cognitions decreased in the TG; posttherapy sexual self-regulation increased. Treatment-related changes were distributed unequally across offender groups. None of the offending behavior reported for the TG was identified as such by the legal authorities. However, five of 25 CSA offenders and 29 of 32 CPO offenders reported ongoing behaviors under therapy. Conclusions. Therapy for pedophiles/hebephiles in the Dunkelfeld can alter child sexual offending DRF and reduce-related behaviors. Unidentified, unlawful child sexual exploitative behaviors are more prevalent in this population than in officially reported recidivism. Further research into factors predictive of problematic sexual behaviors in the Dunkelfeld is warranted. Beier KM, Grundmann D, Kuhle LF, Scherner G, Konrad A, and Amelung T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Preventing Child Sexual Abuse—The Prevention Project Dunkelfeld;,citation_abstract=This article discusses strategies for preventing child sexual abuse. It is well established that childhood adversity, including sexual abuse, dramatically increases the risk for developing a wide range of psychiatric disorders and certain medical diseases later in life. Enduring effects of childhood abuse on the developing brain and its regulatory outflow systems, the autonomic, endocrine and immune systems, very likely to contribute to disease vulnerability. Obviously official statistics account for only a fraction of all cases of child sexual abuse and the use of child abuse images, inappropriately called “child pornography offenses.” Those cases not reported to the authorities constitute the largest part of sexual offenses against children and are in German referred to as Dunkelfeld (literally “dark field”). The Dunkelfeld approach, addressing pedophilia as a diagnosis according to the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision and not as a crime, was successful: on average, 15 to 20 individuals per month contacted the research office in Berlin; from the beginning of the program to September 2017, there were 2,583 applications, 1,078 assessments, and treatment offers for 522 individuals. The help-seeking men had an average age of 37 years. They belonged to all social levels, most were single at the time of questioning, and 1/3 had children of their own. Half of them had already committed child sexual abuse and 3/4 admitted to child pornography offenses in the Dunkelfeld. Currently, the Prevention Project Dunkelfeld is being expanded.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Preventing Child Sexual Abuse and the Use of Child Sexual Abuse Materials: Following up on the German Prevention Project Dunkelfeld;,citation_abstract=Sexual interest in minors (i.e., pedophilia and hebephilia) is considered a risk factor for Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) and the use of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM). This study examined the long-term development of CSA, CSAM use, associated cognitions, and quality of life among self-referred, help-seeking individuals diagnosed with pedophilic or hebephilic disorder (PHD) outside the judicial system. Of the 110 eligible men who had undergone therapy for PHD due to psychological distress or risk of offending, 56 were available for follow-up assessment 1–11 years after treatment. Behavioral manifestations, offense-supportive cognitions, and quality of life were evaluated using interviews and psychometric measures. At followup, 7.7% of participants with a history of CSA had re-offended, whereas 89.1% of previous CSAM users reported recidivism, although with less severe material. No new CSA offenses occurred among those without prior CSA. Treatment led to increased cognitive victim empathy and reductions in CSA-supportive and CSAMsupportive attitudes, but only the latter improvement persisted through follow-up. Participants exhibited elevated CSA-supportive attitudes relative to community norms at all time points and diminished quality of life at follow-up. Pedophilic and hebephilic disorder carry a persistent risk of sexual offending, particularly regarding CSAM use. Therapeutic gains in offense-supportive cognitions may erode over time without ongoing care. A comprehensive public health approach encompassing early detection, prevention, and expanded treatment access that addresses both the risk of reoffending and overall well-being is crucial for reducing sexual victimization and improving mental health outcomes for individuals from this target group.;,citation_author=Klaus M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Preventing Child Sexual Abuse in the “Dunkelfeld”: A Public Health Imperative Requiring Context-Appropriate Science—A Response to König (2025);,citation_abstract=König’s (2025) critique of the German Prevention Project Dunkelfeld mis-applies standards developed for adjudicated (&amp;amp;amp;quot;Hellfeld&amp;quot;) offenders to a voluntary, nonforensic prevention setting. We clarify why context-appropriate science is essential for evaluating interventions that reach individuals whose child sexual abuse (CSA) behaviour remains hidden from the justice system. First, the large gap between official recidivism and high self-reported offending is not methodological failure but strong evidence of the well-documented &quot;dark figure&quot; of undetected sexual crime. Second, Germany’s unique legal framework (§ 65d SGB V; § 203 StGB) enables confidential, face-to-face treatment and pharmacological options that are infeasible in jurisdictions with mandatory reporting, making Dunkelfeld programmes a publichealth imperative. Third, forensic risk tools and the CODC (2007) guidelines lack demonstrated validity for voluntary help-seekers; carefully collected self-report and dynamic risk-factor change therefore constitute the only context-relevant outcome metrics. Fourth, concerns about iatrogenic effects must be interpreted through the Risk-Need-Responsivity lens: specialised, multi-modal interventions such as the Berlin Dissexuality Therapy (BEDIT) show beneficial changes in cognitive and behavioural risk markers, mirroring findings from recent RCTs of internet-delivered CBT and pharmacological therapy. Finally, all German model sites are currently undergoing an independent, multi-year evaluation commissioned by the national health-insurance association. We conclude that preventing CSA and CSAM requires embracing rigorous yet context-sensitive methodologies rather than importing standards that overlook the dark figure. The ethical imperative to prevent harm and offer help to those at risk persists even acknowledging that no intervention guarantees universal success, demanding our most contextually sensitive scientific efforts.;,citation_author=K.

Classic trough-to-peak analysis of these responses is impeded by their apparent superposition. A deconvolution approach is proposed, which separates SC data into continuous signals of tonic and phasic activity. The resulting phasic activity shows a zero baseline, and overlapping SCRs are represented by predominantly distinct, compact impulses showing an average duration of less than 2 s. A time integration of the continuous measure of phasic activity is proposed as a straightforward indicator of event-related sympathetic activity. The quality and benefit of the proposed measure is demonstrated in an experiment with short interstimulus intervals as well as by means of a simulation study.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Decomposition of Skin Conductance Data by Means of Nonnegative Deconvolution;,citation_abstract=Skin conductance (SC) data are usually characterized by a sequence of overlapping phasic skin conductance responses (SCRs) overlying a tonic component. The variability of SCR shapes hereby complicates the proper decomposition of SC data. A method is proposed for full decomposition of SC data into tonic and phasic components. A twocompartment diffusion model was found to adequately describe a standard SCR shape based on the process of sweat diffusion. Nonnegative deconvolution is used to decompose SC data into discrete compact responses and at the same time assess deviations from the standard SCR shape, which could be ascribed to the additional process of pore opening. Based on the result of single non-overlapped SCRs, response parameters can be estimated precisely as shown in a paradigm with varying inter-stimulus intervals.;,citation_author=Mathias Benedek;,citation_author=Christian Kaernbach;,citation_publication_date=2010-03;,citation_cover_date=2010-03;,citation_year=2010;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2009.00972.x;,citation_issn=00485772, 14698986;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychophysiology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Therapieangebote für Männer mit sexuellen Präferenzstörungen und Sexualdelinquenz;,citation_abstract=It is nowadays obsolete to search for the one and only cause of paraphilia and sexual delinquency. Re search supports the assumption that there are at least five different pathways leading to sexual delinquency. The factors contributing to sexual delinquency and paraphilic tendencies cover a spectrum ranging from constitutional factors, sexually and physically traumatizing experiences, current emotional dysregulations to difficulties in social adaptation. Therefore treatment strategies should also be differentiated according to the multifactorial causation and investigations must be carried out to discover which areas of the personality are affected and which aids should be employed. The psychotherapy of sexual offenders over the last two decades has been empirically shown to be effective so that if psychotherapy is offered it would be a mistake not to refer to specific psychological treatment programs for sexual offenders. The medical treatment with, for ex ample, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, naltrexone, antiandrogens, has also been further differentiated.

The elevated plus-maze (EPM) is the gold standard to assess approach-avoidance behavior in rodents. Methods: Here, we translated the EPM to humans using mixed reality through a combination of virtual and realworld elements. In two validation studies, we observed participants’ anxiety on a behavioral, physiological, and subjective level. Results: Participants reported higher anxiety on open arms, avoided open arms, and showed an activation of endogenous stress systems. Participants’ with high anxiety exhibited higher avoidance. Moreover, open arm avoidance was moderately predicted by participants’ acrophobia and sensation seeking, with opposing influences. In a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled experiment, GABAergic stimulation decreased avoidance of open arms while alpha-2-adrenergic antagonism increased avoidance. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate cross-species validity of open arm avoidance as a translational measure of anxiety. We thus introduce the first ecologically valid assay to track actual human approach-avoidance behavior under laboratory conditions.;,citation_author=Sarah V. Biedermann;,citation_author=Daniel G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impact of Time on Task on ADHD Patient’s Performances in a Virtual Classroom;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Use of virtual reality tool is interesting for the evaluation of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients. The virtual environment offers the opportunity to administer controlled task like the typical neuropsychological tools, but in an environment much more like standard classroom. Previous studies showed that a virtual classroom was able to distinguish performances of children with and without ADHD, but the evolution of performances over time has not been explored. The aim of this work was to study time on task effects on performances of ADHD children compared to controls in a virtual classroom (VC). METHODS: 36 boys aged from 7 to 10 years completed the virtual classroom task. We compared the performance of the children diagnosed with ADHD with those of the control children. We also compared attentional performances recorded in the virtual classroom with measures of the Continuous Performance Test (CPT II). RESULTS: Our results showed that patients differ from control subjects in term of time effect on performances. If controls sustained performances over time in the virtual reality task, ADHD patients showed a significant performance decrement over time. Performances at the VC correlated with CPT II measures. CONCLUSION: ADHD children are vulnerable to a time on task effect on performances which could explain part of their difficulties. Virtual reality is a reliable method to test ADHD children ability to sustain performances over time.;,citation_author=Stéphanie Bioulac;,citation_author=Stéphanie Lallemand;,citation_author=Albert Rizzo;,citation_author=Pierre Philip;,citation_author=Colette Fabrigoule;,citation_author=Manuel Pierre Bouvard;,citation_publication_date=2012-09;,citation_cover_date=2012-09;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=5;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.ejpn.2012.01.006;,citation_issn=1532-2130;,citation_pmid=22269913;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=European journal of paediatric neurology: EJPN: official journal of the European Paediatric Neurology Society;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Recommendations for Methodology of Virtual Reality Clinical Trials in Health Care by an International Working Group: Iterative Study;,citation_abstract=Background Therapeutic virtual reality (VR) has emerged as an efficacious treatment modality for a wide range of health conditions. However, despite encouraging outcomes from early stage research, a consensus for the best way to develop and evaluate VR treatments within a scientific framework is needed. Objective We aimed to develop a methodological framework with input from an international working group in order to guide the design, implementation, analysis, interpretation, and communication of trials that develop and test VR treatments. Methods A group of 21 international experts was recruited based on their contributions to the VR literature. The resulting Virtual Reality Clinical Outcomes Research Experts held iterative meetings to seek consensus on best practices for the development and testing of VR treatments. Results The interactions were transcribed, and key themes were identified to develop a scientific framework in order to support best practices in methodology of clinical VR trials. Using the Food and Drug Administration Phase I-III pharmacotherapy model as guidance, a framework emerged to support three phases of VR clinical study designs—VR1, VR2, and VR3. VR1 studies focus on content development by working with patients and providers through the principles of human-centered design. VR2 trials conduct early testing with a focus on feasibility, acceptability, tolerability, and initial clinical efficacy. VR3 trials are randomized, controlled studies that evaluate efficacy against a control condition. Best practice recommendations for each trial were provided.

These studies demonstrate that (1) in the absence of preexisting acidosis, severe acidosis can be prevented by adequate ventilation alone; (2) sodium bicarbonate administration results in a significant rise in arterial Pco2, which parallels the rise in pH despite adequate ventilation; (3) during prolonged cardiac and resuscitation, there is a rise in arterial osmolality that is accentuated by sodium bicarbonate. These studies suggest that sodium bicarbonate should not be used during resuscitation (1) in the absence of effective hyperventilation or where carbon dioxide removal is inadequate despite adequate ventilation, (2) in repeated doses, without confirmation of substantial acidosis, or (3) when cardiac arrest has been of brief duration and preexisting acidosis is unlikely.

The current study compared the risk factors that differentiated between sexual recidivists and nonrecidivists between the two research designs: original case–control and updated prospective cohort. Of the 82 comparisons, 50 favored the prospective design while 32 favored the case–control; however, most of the differences were small and nonsignificant. Static and dynamic risk factors were approximately equivalent between study designs. Factors identified as sex-specific (e.g., sexual deviancy) were also equivalent between designs while general risk factors (e.g., substance use) were more likely identified in the prospective design. Overall, case–control studies can be used for the identification of risk factors, especially for low base rate behaviors such as sexual recidivism.;,citation_author=Julie Blais;,citation_author=R.

The proposed solution TrainAR combines an interaction concept, a didactic framework and an authoring tool for procedural AR training applications for smartphones. The contribution of this paper is the opensource visual scripting-based authoring tool of TrainAR in the form of a Unity Editor extension. With this approach, TrainAR allows non-programmer domain experts to create (“author”) their own procedural AR trainings by offering a customized editor, while at any time programmers may decide to utilize Unity’s full capabilities. Furthermore, utility and usability evaluations of several already developed TrainAR trainings (combined n = 317) show that TrainAR trainings provide utility in several contexts and are usable by the target groups. A systematic usability evaluation of the TrainAR Authoring Tool (n = 30) shows that it would be usable by non-programmer domain experts, though the learning curve depends on the media competency of the authors.;,citation_author=Jonas Blattgerste;,citation_author=Jan Behrends;,citation_author=Thies Pfeiffer;,citation_publication_date=2023-04;,citation_cover_date=2023-04;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.3390/info14040219;,citation_issn=2078-2489;,citation_volume=14;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Information;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brain Alterations Potentially Associated with Aggression and Terrorism;,citation_abstract=A large proportion of the persons who join terrorist groups as well as lone-acting terrorists have a history of violent behavior or mental disorder that predated their becoming terrorists. This suggests that brain alterations found to occur in violent perpetrators may also be present in a significant percentage of terrorists. After a short delineation of phylogenetically old neuronal networks that are important for the generation of aggressive behavior in inconspicuous brains, this review summarizes structural and functional brain-imaging studies in violent offenders published over the last 10 years. Depending on the subtype of violence (impulsive or instrumental), deviations in structure or function were mainly found in the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and insular cortex, as well as in temporolimbic structures (e.g., the amygdala, hippocampus, and parahippocampus). These brain areas are essentially responsible for the control of the archaic neuronal generators of aggression located in the hypothalamus and limbic system. This regional distribution of brain alterations also shows a remarkable overlap with those brain regions that are crucial for such prosocial traits as empathy and compassion. Feelings of superiority, dominance, and satisfaction gained by performing violent and terroristic attacks suggest that a hedonistic component via an activation of brain reward systems plays an additional role. In our current debate about the causes of terrorism, aspects of brain dysfunction should receive more attention.;,citation_author=Bernhard Bogerts;,citation_author=Maria Schöne;,citation_author=Stephanie Breitschuh;,citation_publication_date=2018-04;,citation_cover_date=2018-04;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1017/S1092852917000463;,citation_issn=1092-8529, 2165-6509;,citation_volume=23;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=CNS Spectrums;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Love Is in the Gaze: An Eye-Tracking Study of Love and Sexual Desire;,citation_abstract=Reading other people’s eyes is a valuable skill during interpersonal interaction. Although a number of studies have investigated visual patterns in relation to the perceiver’s interest, intentions, and goals, little is known about eye gaze when it comes to differentiating intentions to love from intentions to lust (sexual desire). To address this question, we conducted two experiments: one testing whether the visual pattern related to the perception of love differs from that related to lust and one testing whether the visual pattern related to the expression of love differs from that related to lust. Our results show that a person’s eye gaze shifts as a function of his or her goal (love vs. lust) when looking at a visual stimulus. Such identification of distinct visual patterns for love and lust could have theoretical and clinical importance in couples therapy when these two phenomena are difficult to disentangle from one another on the basis of patients’ self-reports.;,citation_author=Mylene Bolmont;,citation_author=John T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Studying Social Interactions through Immersive Virtual Environment Technology: Virtues, Pitfalls, and Future Challenges;,citation_abstract=The goal of the present review is to explain how immersive virtual environment technology (IVET) can be used for the study of social interactions and how the use of virtual humans in immersive virtual environments can advance research and application in many different fields. Researchers studying individual differences in social interactions are typically interested in keeping the behavior and the appearance of the interaction partner constant across participants. With IVET researchers have full control over the interaction partners, can standardize them while still keeping the simulation realistic. Virtual simulations are valid: growing evidence shows that indeed studies conducted with IVET can replicate some well-known findings of social psychology. Moreover, IVET allows researchers to subtly manipulate characteristics of the environment (e.g., visual cues to prime participants) or of the social partner (e.g., his/her race) to investigate their influences on participants’ behavior and cognition. Furthermore, manipulations that would be difficult or impossible in real life (e.g., changing participants’ height) can be easily obtained with IVET. Beside the advantages for theoretical research, we explore the most recent training and clinical applications of IVET, its integration with other technologies (e.g., social sensing) and future challenges for researchers (e.g., making the communication between virtual humans and participants smoother).;,citation_author=Dario Bombari;,citation_author=Marianne Schmid Mast;,citation_author=Elena Canadas;,citation_author=Manuel Bachmann;,citation_publication_date=2015-06;,citation_cover_date=2015-06;,citation_year=2015;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00869;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Risk–Need–Responsivity Model and Justice-Involved Persons with Serious Mental Illness;,citation_abstract=The assessment and rehabilitation of justice-involved persons with serious mental illness (SMI) present unique challenges to the criminal justice system. For persons without mental health challenges, the risk–need–responsivity (RNR) model has had an enormous impact on what to assess and how best to deliver treatment to those in need. This paper poses the general question, Is RNR relevant to justice-involved persons with SMI? We argue that the critical risk/need factors, called the Central Eight, are as important to those with SMI as they are to those with no SMI. Unfortunately, assessment protocols that incorporate the Central Eight are quite rare in the literature. When we turn to lessons from the RNR model for the rehabilitation of justice-involved persons with SMI the research is even more scant. On a positive note, we provide an illustration of an RNR-based model of community supervision that demonstrates reductions in general and violent recidivism, STICS. The STICS model serves as an example of how effective treatment can be applied with persons with SMI.;,citation_author=James Bonta;,citation_author=Seung C.

Going beyond assessment of cue reactivity, a novel VR-based treatment approach for smoking cessation was developed and tested for feasibility. Method: In a randomized experiment, 10-week treatment feasibility trial, 46 nicotine-dependent adults, completed the10-week program. Virtual reality skills training (VRST) combined with nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was compared to NRT alone. Participants were assessed for smoking behavior and coping skills during, at end of treatment, and at posttreatment follow-up. Results: Smoking rates and craving for nicotine were significantly lower for the VRST group compared to NRT-only group at the end of treatment. Self-confidence and coping skills were also significantly higher for the VRST group, and number of cigarettes smoked was significantly lower, compared to the control group at follow-up.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What Virtual Reality Research in Addictions Can Tell Us about the Future of Obesity Assessment and Treatment;,citation_abstract=Virtual reality (VR), a system of human–computer interaction that allows researchers and clinicians to immerse people in virtual worlds, is gaining considerable traction as a research, education, and treatment tool. Virtual reality has been used successfully to treat anxiety disorders such as fear of flying and post-traumatic stress disorder, as an aid in stroke rehabilitation, and as a behavior modification aid in the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Virtual reality has also been employed in research on addictive disorders. Given the strong evidence that drug-dependent people are highly prone to use and relapse in the presence of environmental stimuli associated with drug use, VR is an ideal platform from which to study this relationship. Research using VR has shown that drug-dependent people react with strong craving to specific cues (e.g., cigarette packs, liquor bottles) as well as environments or settings (e.g., bar, party) associated with drug use. Virtual reality has also been used to enhance learning and generalization of relapse prevention skills in smokers by reinforcing these skills in lifelike environments. Obesity researchers and treatment professionals, building on the lessons learned from VR research in substance abuse, have the opportunity to adapt these methods for investigating their own research and treatment questions. Virtual reality is ideally suited to investigate the link between food cues and environmental settings with eating behaviors and self-report of hunger. In addition, VR can be used as a treatment tool for enhancing behavior modification goals to support healthy eating habits by reinforcing these goals in life–like situations.;,citation_author=Patrick S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification and Comprehensive Characterization of Moral Disapproval and Behavioral Dysregulation-Based Pornography-Use Profiles across 42 Countries;,citation_abstract=Background and aims The Moral Incongruence Model of Pornography Use proposes that pornography-use-related problems may be present due to problematic pornography use (PPU) and/or moral disapproval (MD) of pornography use. Despite some supporting empirical evidence, no study has tested the presence of different pornography-use profiles based on individuals’ behavioral dysregulation (i.e., PPU) and moral values concerning pornography use. The generalizability of previous findings to diverse populations has also been limited given the scarcity of studies conducted outside of Western countries. Methods Using data from the International Sex Survey (42 countries, N = 66,994; Mage = 32.16 years, SD = 12.27), we conducted latent profile analysis to identify pornography-use profiles based on individuals’ frequency of use, MD, and PPU. The profiles were compared along a wide range of pornography-use-related, sexuality-related, and psychological correlates. Results Six pornography-use profiles were identified, including two increased risk groups (i.e., Increased risk of PPU without MD and Increased risk of PPU with some MD). Several factors differentiated between the increased risk vs. no/low risk profiles (e.g., relatedness satisfaction) as well as between the two increased risk profiles (e.g., religiosity). Apart from behavioral dysregulation, moral values concerning pornography use played an important role in distinguishing pornography-use profiles and demonstrated the importance of inquiring about MD when working with individuals with pornography-use-related problems. Conclusion Findings also support recent calls for better-integrated sex therapy and sexual medicine perspectives into pornography-use-related problems research and care.;,citation_author=Beáta Bőthe;,citation_author=István Tóth-Király;,citation_author=Nevena Popova;,citation_author=Léna Nagy;,citation_author=Mónika Koós;,citation_author=Zsolt Demetrovics;,citation_author=Marc N.

T reflexes are augmented in states of appetitive and defensive action and modified by differences in arousal intensity. Reflexes were expected to be facilitated by both pleasant (sexual) and unpleasant (anxiety) stimuli. Subjects were exposed to a sexual, an anxiety-inducing, a sexually threatening, and a neutral film excerpt. Genital arousal, emotional experience, subjective action tendencies, and T reflexes were monitored. Self-report and genital data confirmed the affective states as intended. T reflex amplitude significantly increased during viewing of emotionally arousing film excerpts as compared with a neutral film excerpt. T reflexes were facilitated by the sex stimulus to the same extent as by the anxiety and sexual threat stimuli. The results support the view of sexual arousal as an emotional state, generating sex-specific autonomic and general somatic motor system responses, which prepare the organism for action.;,citation_author=Stephanie Both;,citation_author=Walter Everaerd;,citation_author=Ellen Laan;,citation_publication_date=2003-03;,citation_cover_date=2003-03;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1111/1469-8986.00019;,citation_issn=0048-5772, 1469-8986;,citation_volume=40;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychophysiology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Manipulating Subjective Realism and Its Impact on Presence: Preliminary Results on Feasibility and Neuroanatomical Correlates;,citation_abstract=The feeling of presence has been shown to be an important concept in several clinical applications of virtual reality. Among the factors influencing presence, realism factors have been examined extensively from the angle of objective realism. Objective realism has been manipulated by altering numerous technological characteristics such as pictorial quality, texture and shading, or by adding more sensory information (i.e., smell, touch). Much less studied is the subjective (or perceived) realism, the focus of the two pilot studies reported in this article. In Study 1, subjective realism was manipulated in order to assess the impact on the feeling of presence. Method: Presence was measured in 31 adults after two immersions in virtual reality. Participants were immersed in a neutral/irrelevant virtual environment and subsequently subjected to the experimental manipulation. Participants in the experimental condition were falsely led to believe that they were immersed live in real time in a “real” room with a “real” mouse in a cage. In the control condition, participants believed they were immersed in a replica of the nearby room. All participants were actually immersed in the exact same virtual environment. Results: A manipulation check revealed that 80% of the participants believed in the deception. A 2 Times by 2 Conditions repeated measure ANOVA revealed that leading people to believe they were seeing a real environment digitized live in virtual reality increased their feeling of presence compared to the control condition. In Study 2, the same experimental design was used but with simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in order to assess brain areas potentially related to the feeling of presence. fMRI data from five participants were subjected to a within subject fixed effect analysis to verify differences between the experimental immersion (higher presence) and the control immersion (lower presence). Results revealed a statistically significant difference in left and right parahippocampus areas. Conclusion: Results are discussed according to layers of presence and consciousness and the meaning given to experiences occurring in virtual reality.

Using real-time motion capture the VB can be programmed to move synchronously with the real body (visuomotor synchrony), and also virtual objects seen to strike the VB can be felt through corresponding vibrotactile stimulation on the actual body (visuotactile synchrony). This setup typically gives rise to a strong perceptual illusion of ownership over the VB. When the viewpoint is lifted up and out of the VB so that it is seen below this may result in an out-of-body experience (OBE). In a two-factor between-groups experiment with 16 female participants per group we tested how fear of death might be influenced by two different methods for producing an OBE. In an initial embodiment phase where both groups experienced the same multisensory stimuli there was a strong feeling of body ownership. Then the viewpoint was lifted up and behind the VB. In the experimental group once the viewpoint was out of the VB there was no further connection with it (no visuomotor or visuotactile synchrony). In a control condition, although the viewpoint was in the identical place as in the experimental group, visuomotor and visuotactile synchrony continued. While both groups reported high scores on a question about their OBE illusion, the experimental group had a greater feeling of disownership towards the VB below compared to the control group, in line with previous findings. Fear of death in the experimental group was found to be lower than in the control group. This is in line with previous reports that naturally occurring OBEs are often associated with enhanced belief in life after death.;,citation_author=Pierre Bourdin;,citation_author=Itxaso Barberia;,citation_author=Ramon Oliva;,citation_author=Mel Slater;,citation_editor=Gavin Buckingham;,citation_publication_date=2017-01;,citation_cover_date=2017-01;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0169343;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PLOS ONE;">

Results from a sample of 620 incarcerated male offenders—482 who received either a 5-week, 10-week, or 15-week prison-based treatment program and 138 untreated comparison offenders—found that treatment significantly reduced recidivism (odds ratio of .56; effect size r of .10) and that the amount of treatment (e.g., “dosage”) played a significant role (odds ratios between .92 and .95 per week of treatment; adjusted effect size r of .01 and .02).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Between October 2009 and July 2012, a total of 286 eligible individuals who successfully completed initial treatment for substance use disorders at a private, nonprofit treatment facility were randomized to MBRP, RP, or TAU aftercare and monitored for 12 months. Participants medically cleared for continuing care were aged 18 to 70 years; 71.5% were male and 42.1% were of ethnic/racial minority. INTERVENTIONS Participants were randomly assigned to 8 weekly group sessions of MBRP, cognitive-behavioral RP, or TAU. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes included relapse to drug use and heavy drinking as well as frequency of substance use in the past 90 days. Variables were assessed at baseline and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up points. Measures used included self-report of relapse and urinalysis drug and alcohol screenings. RESULTS Compared with TAU, participants assigned to MBRP and RP reported significantly lower risk of relapse to substance use and heavy drinking and, among those who used substances, significantly fewer days of substance use and heavy drinking at the 6-month follow-up. Cognitive-behavioral RP showed an advantage over MBRP in time to first drug use. At the 12-month follow-up, MBRP participants reported significantly fewer days of substance use and significantly decreased heavy drinking compared with RP and TAU. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE For individuals in aftercare following initial treatment for substance use disorders, RP and MBRP, compared with TAU, produced significantly reduced relapse risk to drug use and heavy drinking. Relapse prevention delayed time to first drug use at 6-month follow-up, with MBRP and RP participants who used alcohol also reporting significantly fewer heavy drinking days compared with TAU participants. At 12-month follow-up, MBRP offered added benefit over RP and TAU in reducing drug use and heavy drinking. Targeted mindfulness practices may support long-term outcomes by strengthening the ability to monitor and skillfully cope with discomfort associated with craving or negative affect, thus supporting long-term outcomes.;,citation_author=Sarah Bowen;,citation_author=Katie Witkiewitz;,citation_author=Seema L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Natural Selective Attention: Orienting and Emotion;,citation_abstract=The foundations of orienting and attention are hypothesized to stem from activation of defensive and appetitive motivational systems that evolved to protect and sustain the life of the individual. Motivational activation initiates a cascade of perceptual and motor processes that facilitate the selection of appropriate behavior. Among these are detection of significance, indexed by a late centro-parietal positivity in the event-related potential, enhanced perceptual processing, indexed by a initial cardiac deceleration, and preparation for action, indexed by electrodermal changes. Data exploring the role of stimulus novelty and significance in orienting are presented that indicate different components of the orienting response habituate at different rates.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pharmacotherapy of Paraphilias With Long-Acting Agonists of Luteinizing Hormone–Releasing Hormone: A Systematic Review;,citation_abstract=Background: In addition to psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy is an important treatment option for paraphilias, especially in sexual offenders. Cyproterone acetate (CPA) and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) are commonly used but can have serious side effects. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may also be effective in less severe cases. Recent research shows that luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists may offer a new treatment option for treatment of paraphilic patients. Method: MEDLINE was searched for clinical trials, case-control studies, case reports, and other clinically and theoretically important literature published between 1980 and November 2002 on the treatment of paraphilia with LHRH agonists. Keywords included LHRH agonists, GnRHagonists, antiandrogens, paraphilia, pedophilia, and sex offenders. Results: We found 4 case reports, 1 casecontrol study, 7 open uncontrolled studies, and 1 study comparing patients receiving CPA with those receiving LHRH agonist treatment in forensic hospitals. In total, the studies reported on a sample of 118 treated patients with different forms of paraphilias (sadism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism). Nearly all of the studies used self-reports to measure the effects of medication. Duration of follow-up was between 6 months and 7 years and revealed that there were no relapses if patients remained under treatment. Patients previously treated with other agents like CPA, MPA, or SSRIs reported better effects when taking LHRH agonists. Conclusion: Although there is a need for further research, LHRH agonists offer a treatment option for patients with severe paraphilia. We propose a differentiated pharmacologic treatment regarding side effects, symptomatology, and severity.

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Review guidelines, we analyzed articles employing questionnaires to evaluate user experience in virtual reality-based health applications for adults. Following a meticulous screening process of 325 papers across PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases, 17 studies met our inclusion criteria. Studies predominantly used multiple and diverse questionnaires exploring several dimensions. Eight key user experience dimensions emerged: usability and functionality, aesthetics of design, engagement, emotional state, presence, realism of environments, side effects, and motivation and intention of use.

It is demonstrated by means of a simulation study that the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-test may be conservative or liberal depending on the ratio of the sample sizes and the variances of the underlying distribution functions. For the suggested approximation, however, it turns out that the nominal level is maintained rather accurately. The suggested nonparametric procedure is applied to a data set from a clinical trial. Moreover, a confidence interval for the nonparametric treatment effect is given.;,citation_author=Edgar Brunner;,citation_author=Ullrich Munzel;,citation_publication_date=2000;,citation_cover_date=2000;,citation_year=2000;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-4036(200001)42:1&amp;amp;amp;lt;17::AID-BIMJ17&amp;gt;3.0.CO;2-U;,citation_issn=1521-4036;,citation_volume=42;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Biometrical Journal;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Big, the Rich, and the Powerful: Physical, Financial, and Social Dimensions of Dominance in Mating and Attraction;,citation_abstract=Dominance is a key feature on which romantic partners are evaluated, yet there is no clear consensus on its definition. In Study 1 (N = 305), the authors developed scales to measure three putatively distinct dimensions of dominance: social, financial, and physical. In Study 2 (N = 308), the authors used their scales in a mate-selection paradigm and found that women perceived physical dominance to be related to both attractiveness and social dominance. For both sexes, attractiveness predicted desirability for a one-night stand, whereas attractiveness and agreeableness were predictors of desirability for a serious relationship. In Study 3 (N = 124), the authors surveyed romantic partners in monogamous relationships and found that although aspects of a partner’s dominance—financial for women and social for men—played a bivariate role in relationship satisfaction, agreeableness was the strongest predictor of current and future relationship satisfaction and the only significant predictor of relationship dissolution.;,citation_author=Angela D.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Two-group randomized clinical trial conducted between March 1, 2013, and March 4, 2015. Participants were recruited in Germany from the general population via a large statutory health insurance company (ie, insurance funded by joint employer-employee contributions). Participants included 406 self-selected adults with subthreshold depression (Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score Ն16, no current MDD according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [Fourth Edition, Text Revision] criteria). INTERVENTIONS All participants had unrestricted access to usual care (visits to the primary care clinician) and were randomized to either a web-based guided self-help intervention (cognitive-behavioral and problem-solving therapy supported by an online trainer; n = 202) or a web-based psychoeducation program (n = 204). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was time to onset of MDD in the intervention group relative to the control group over a 12-month follow-up period as assessed by blinded diagnostic raters using the telephone-administered Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis Disorders at 6- and 12-month follow-up, covering the period to the previous assessment. RESULTS Among 406 randomized patients (mean age, 45 years; 73.9% women), 335 (82%) completed the telephone follow-up at 12 months. Fifty-five participants (27%) in the intervention group experienced MDD compared with 84 participants (41%) in the control group. Cox regression analyses controlling for baseline depressive symptom severity revealed a hazard ratio of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.42-0.82; P = .002) at 12-month follow-up. The number needed to treat to avoid 1 new case of MDD was 5.9 (95% CI, 3.9-14.6). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with subthreshold depression, the use of a web-based guided self-help intervention compared with enhanced usual care reduced the incidence of MDD over 12 months. Further research is needed to understand whether the effects are generalizable to both first onset of depression and depression recurrence as well as efficacy without the use of an online trainer.;,citation_author=Claudia Buntrock;,citation_author=David Daniel Ebert;,citation_author=Dirk Lehr;,citation_author=Filip Smit;,citation_author=Heleen Riper;,citation_author=Matthias Berking;,citation_author=Pim Cuijpers;,citation_publication_date=2016-05;,citation_cover_date=2016-05;,citation_year=2016;,citation_issue=17;,citation_doi=10.1001/jama.2016.4326;,citation_issn=0098-7484;,citation_volume=315;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=JAMA;">

The model is based on the theoretical assumption that cognitive distortions emerge from more general explanatory theories. It seems that the pathways of offending processes that are characterized by positive or negative affects can be found in all treated sex offenders regardless of their motivation. We assume that these pathways are activated by cognitive distortions that illustrate the underlying general explanatory theory held by the offender and that these distortions are typical for overall daily interpersonal behavior of the offender This means that, as predicted by our clinical model in the case of offenders with a personality disorder, the type of explanatory cognition that is underlying their sexual offenses is the same as the one that is underlying their general explanatory theories.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Evolution of Human Mating;,citation_abstract=Mating is close to the engine of the evolutionary process—differential reproductive success. As descendants of reproductively successful ancestors, modern humans have inherited the mating strategies that led to our ancestor’s success. These strategies include long-term committed mating (e.g., marriage), short-term mating (e.g., a brief sexual encounter), extra-pair mating (e.g., infidelity), mate poaching (luring another person’s mate), and mate guarding (effort devoted to keeping a mate). Since men and women historically confronted different adaptive problems in the mating domain, the sexes differ profoundly in evolved psychology of mating solutions. These psychological sex differences include possessing distinct mate preferences, dissimilar desires for short-term mating, and distinct triggers that evoke sexual jealousy. This article reviews empirical evidence supporting evolution-based hypotheses about these mating strategies. The study of human mating is one of the true “success stories” of evolutionary psychology.;,citation_author=David M Buss;,citation_language=en-US;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reading the Mind from Eye Gaze;,citation_abstract=Baron-Cohen [Mindblindness: an essay on autism and theory of mind. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1997] has suggested that the interpretation of gaze plays an important role in a normal functioning theory of mind (ToM) system. Consistent with this suggestion, functional imaging research has shown that both ToM tasks and eye gaze processing engage a similar region of the posterior superior temporal sulcus (STS). However, a second brain region associated with ToM, the medial prefrontal (MPF) cortex, has not been identified by previous eye gaze studies. We discuss the methodological issues that may account for the absence of MPF activation in these experiments and present a PET study that controls for these factors. Our experiment included three conditions in which the proportions of faces gazing at, and away from, the participant, were as follows: 100% direct [0% averted], 50% direct—50% averted, and 100% horizontally averted [0% direct]. Two control conditions were also included in which the faces’ gaze were averted down, or their eyes were closed. Contrasts comparing the gaze conditions with each of the control conditions revealed medial frontal involvement. Parametric analyses showed a significant linear relationship between increasing proportions of horizontally averted gaze and increased rCBF in the MPF cortex. The opposite parametric analysis (increasing proportions of direct gaze) was associated with increased rCBF in a number of areas including the superior and medial temporal gyri. Additional subtraction contrasts largely confirmed these patterns. Our results demonstrate a considerable degree of overlap between the medial frontal areas involved in eye gaze processing and theory of mind tasks. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Internet-Delivered Treatment for Substance Abuse: A Multisite Randomized Controlled Trial;,citation_abstract=Method—Adult men and women (N=507) entering 10 outpatient addiction treatment programs were randomly assigned to 12-weeks of treatment-as-usual (n=252) or treatment-as-usual + Therapeutic Education System, whereby the intervention substituted for 2 hours of standard care per week (n=255). Therapeutic Education System consists of 62 computer-interactive modules covering skills for achieving and maintaining abstinence, plus prize-based motivational incentives contingent on abstinence and treatment adherence. Treatment-as-usual consisted of individual and group counseling at the participating programs. Primary outcomes were (1) abstinence from drugs and heavy drinking measured by twice weekly urine drug screens and self-report, and (2) time to drop-out from treatment. Results—Compared to treatment-as-usual, those receiving Therapeutic Education System reduced dropout from treatment (Hazard Ratio=0.72 [95% CI, 0.57-0.92], P=.010), and increased abstinence (Odds Ratio=1.62 [95% CI: 1.12-2.35], P=.010), an effect that was more pronounced among patients with a positive urine drug and/or breath alcohol screen at the point of study entry (n=228) (Odds Ratio=2.18 [95% CI: 1.30-3.68], P=.003).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cerebral White Matter Deficiencies in Pedophilic Men;,citation_abstract=The present investigation sought to identify which brain regions distinguish pedophilic from nonpedophilic men, using unbiased, automated analyses of the whole brain. T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were acquired from men who demonstrated illegal or clinically significant sexual behaviors or interests (n = 65) and from men who had histories of nonsexual offenses but no sexual offenses (n = 62). Sexual interest in children was assessed by participants’ admissions of pedophilic interest, histories of committing sexual offenses against children, and psychophysiological responses in the laboratory to erotic stimuli depicting children or adults. Automated parcellation of the MRIs revealed significant negative associations between pedophilia and white matter volumes of the temporal and parietal lobes bilaterally. Voxel-based morphometry corroborated the associations and indicated that the regions of lower white matter volumes followed, and were limited to, two major fiber bundles: the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the right arcuate fasciculus. No significant differences were found in grey matter or in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Because the superior fronto-occipital and arcuate fasciculi connect the cortical regions that respond to sexual cues, these results suggest (1) that those cortical regions operate as a network for recognizing sexually relevant stimuli and (2) that pedophilia results from a partial disconnection within that network.

The current study investigated the effectiveness of a low-intensity treatment program, both in terms of participants’ recidivism outcomes and in terms of broader organizational/systems impacts. The results demonstrated low base rate recidivism across both program participants ( n = 311) and a comparison group of men who were assessed as demonstrating similar static sexual offence recidivism risk ( n = 391), and little evidence of reduced recidivism following treatment. However, program administration led to many potential participants being identified as demonstrating higher levels of dynamic risk and overridden to more intensive treatment options ( n = 101). Given evidence that such options do effectively reduce recidivism in higher risk populations, these findings may suggest an overall positive net effect.;,citation_author=Angela Carr;,citation_author=Gwenda Willis;,citation_publication_date=2021-09;,citation_cover_date=2021-09;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1177/10790632211042365;,citation_volume=34;,citation_journal_title=Sexual Abuse;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Computer-Assisted Delivery of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy: Efficacy and Durability of CBT4CBT Among Cocaine-Dependent Individuals Maintained on Methadone;,citation_abstract=Objectives—A previous pilot trial evaluating computer-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT4CBT) among 77 heterogeneous substance users (alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, opioids) provided preliminary support for its efficacy in the context of a community-based outpatient clinic. Aims of the present trial were to conduct a more definitive trial in a larger, more homogeneous sample. Methods—Randomized clinical trial in which 101 cocaine-dependent methadone maintained individuals were randomized to standard methadone maintenance or methadone maintenance with weekly access to CBT4CBT, with 7 modules delivered within an 8 week trial. Results—Treatment retention and data availability were high and comparable across the treatment conditions. Participants assigned to the CBT4CBT condition were significantly more likely to attain three or more consecutive weeks of abstinence from cocaine (36 versus 17%, p$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$. 05, OR=.36). The group assigned to CBT4CBT also had better outcomes on most dimensions, including urine specimens negative for all drugs, but these reached statistical significance only for the completer sample (N=69). Follow-up data collected 6 months after treatment termination were available from 93% of the randomized sample; these indicated continued improvement for those assigned to the CBT4CBTgroup, replicating previous findings regarding its durability. Conclusions—This trial replicates earlier findings indicating CBT4CBT is an effective adjunct to addiction treatment with durable effects.

Eye movements were recorded while participants viewed a series of picture pairs depicting negative, positive, and neutral scenes (each pair presented for 3 s). Biases in initial orienting were assessed from the direction and latency of the initial shift in gaze, whereas biases in the maintenance of attention were assessed from the duration of gaze on the picture that was initially fixated. Results indicated that the dysphoric group showed a significantly greater bias to maintain gaze longer on negative pictures, relative to control pictures, compared with the nondysphoric group. There was no evidence of a dysphoria-related bias in initial shift of orienting to negative cues.

The potential benefits of mindfulness underpin a range of therapeutic intervention approaches designed to increase mindfulness in both clinical and community contexts. Self-guided mindfulness-based interventions may be a way to increase access to the benefits of mindfulness. This study explored whether a brief, online, mindfulness-based intervention can increase mindfulness and reduce perceived stress and anxiety/depression symptoms within a student population. Method: One hundred and four students were randomly allocated to either immediately start a twoweek, self-guided, online, mindfulness-based intervention or a wait-list control. Measures of mindfulness, perceived stress and anxiety/depression were administered before and after the intervention period. Results: Intention to treat analysis identified significant group by time interactions for mindfulness skills, perceived stress and anxiety/depression symptoms. Participation in the intervention was associated with significant improvements in all measured domains, where no significant changes on these measures were found for the control group. Conclusions: This provides evidence in support of the feasibility and effectiveness of shorter self-guided mindfulness-based interventions.

It was predicted that, relative to heterosexual and homosexual stimuli, bisexual men would show the highest levels of sexual arousal to bisexual erotic material, while this stimulus would induce relatively low levels of response in heterosexual and homosexual men. A sample of 59 men (19 homosexual, 13 bisexual, and 27 heterosexual) were presented with a series of 4-min sexual videos while their genital and subjective sexual responses were measured continuously. Bisexual men did not differ significantly in their responses to male homosexual stimuli (depicting men engaging in sex) from homosexual men, and they did not differ significantly in their responses to heterosexual (depicting two women, without same-sex contact, engaged in sex with a man) and lesbian (depicting women engaging in sex) stimuli from heterosexual men. However, bisexual men displayed significantly higher levels of both genital and subjective sexual arousal to a bisexual stimulus (depicting a man engaged in sex with both a man and a woman) than either homosexual or heterosexual men. The findings of this study indicate that bisexuality in men is associated with a unique and specific pattern of sexual arousal.;,citation_author=Jerome A.

In particular, a visually improved VR does not necessarily result in decreased VR sickness. To understand these unexpected results, we surveyed the causes of VR sickness and measurement of symptoms. We reorganized the causes of the VR sickness into three major factors (hardware, content, and human factors) and investigated the sub-component of each factor. We then surveyed frequently used mea sures of VR sickness, both subjective and objective approaches.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=SPIRIT 2025 Statement: Updated Guideline for Protocols of Randomised Trials;,citation_abstract=Abstract Importance The protocol of a randomised trial is the foundation for study planning, conduct, reporting, and external review. However, trial protocols vary in their completeness and often do not address key elements of design and conduct. The SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) statement was first published in 2013 as guidance to improve the completeness of trial protocols. Periodic updates incorporating the latest evidence and best practices are needed to ensure that the guidance remains relevant to users. Objective To systematically update the SPIRIT recommendations for minimum items to address in the protocol of a randomised trial. Design We completed a scoping review and developed a project specific database of empirical and theoretical evidence to generate a list of potential changes to the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. The list was enriched with recommendations provided by lead authors of existing SPIRIT/CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) extensions (Harms, Outcomes, Non-pharmacological Treatment) and other reporting guidelines (TIDieR). The potential modifications were rated in a three-round Delphi survey followed by a consensus meeting. Findings Overall, 317 individuals participated in the Delphi consensus process and 30 experts attended the consensus meeting. The process led to the addition of two new protocol items, revision to five items, deletion/merger of five items, and integration of key items from other relevant reporting guidelines. Notable changes include a new open science section, additional emphasis on the assessment of harms and description of interventions and comparators, and a new item on how patients and the public will be involved in trial design, conduct, and reporting. The updated SPIRIT 2025 statement consists of an evidence based checklist of 34 minimum items to address in a trial protocol, along with a diagram illustrating the schedule of enrolment, interventions, and assessments for trial participants. To facilitate implementation, we also developed an expanded version of the SPIRIT 2025 checklist and an accompanying explanation and elaboration document. Conclusions and relevance Widespread endorsement and adherence to the updated SPIRIT 2025 statement have the potential to enhance the transparency and completeness of trial protocols for the benefit of investigators, trial participants, patients, funders, research ethics committees, journals, trial registries, policymakers, regulators, and other reviewers.;,citation_author=An-Wen Chan;,citation_author=Isabelle Boutron;,citation_author=Sally Hopewell;,citation_author=David Moher;,citation_author=Kenneth F Schulz;,citation_author=Gary S Collins;,citation_author=Ruth Tunn;,citation_author=Rakesh Aggarwal;,citation_author=Michael Berkwits;,citation_author=Jesse A Berlin;,citation_author=Nita Bhandari;,citation_author=Nancy J Butcher;,citation_author=Marion K Campbell;,citation_author=Runcie C W Chidebe;,citation_author=Diana R Elbourne;,citation_author=Andrew J Farmer;,citation_author=Dean A Fergusson;,citation_author=Robert M Golub;,citation_author=Steven N Goodman;,citation_author=Tammy C Hoffmann;,citation_author=John P A Ioannidis;,citation_author=Brennan C Kahan;,citation_author=Rachel L Knowles;,citation_author=Sarah E Lamb;,citation_author=Steff Lewis;,citation_author=Elizabeth Loder;,citation_author=Martin Offringa;,citation_author=Philippe Ravaud;,citation_author=Dawn P Richards;,citation_author=Frank W Rockhold;,citation_author=David L Schriger;,citation_author=Nandi L Siegfried;,citation_author=Sophie Staniszewska;,citation_author=Rod S Taylor;,citation_author=Lehana Thabane;,citation_author=David J Torgerson;,citation_author=Sunita Vohra;,citation_author=Ian R White;,citation_author=Asbjørn Hróbjartsson;,citation_publication_date=2025-04;,citation_cover_date=2025-04;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1136/bmj-2024-081477;,citation_issn=1756-1833;,citation_volume=389;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=BMJ;">

As the amount and types of available public information have grown, scholars have capitalized on this access by constructing open-source databases. Our review found extraordinary growth in this research area and that these flexible methods have been used to study a range of important topics, including issues that have been historically challenging to research. These methods have been most impactful in the study of rare events, such as school shootings, terrorism, and mass shootings. Some studies have become core works that significantly impacted criminology and other scientific disciplines, and the limits of the use of sources have yet to be determined. Our review of this literature found variations in the methodological approach to constructing such databases. Many studies did not evaluate the credibility of the open-source information they relied upon and often were not transparent in describing their research process. We identify the different processual elements of systematically developing and using such data. We highlight the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, set forth best practices, and discuss how to improve methodological rigor and oversight in future research.;,citation_author=Steven M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Virtual Stealth Assessment: A New Methodological Approach for Assessing Psychological Needs;,citation_abstract=In the past decade, the use of technology is extensively increased. Technological systems as virtual reality represent nowadays novel and efficacy tools in several areas, such as in psychology and education. Realism, sense of presence, engagement, experimental control, and ecological validity represent some of the advantages than traditional methods based on paper and pencil tests. Furthermore, psychological research gathering information about a person relative to specific attributes, such as abilities, personality, and cognitive competences is usually conducted using pre-test-post-test designs. Such traditional assessments are not able to catch and examine the dynamic and composite performances and behaviours in run. Virtual stealth assessment could provide a valid and reliable method for evaluating real behaviours in real-time during the virtual experience. In this article, we proposed stealth assessment as a new methodological approach to study the Grawe’s model on the basic psychological needs by using virtual immersive environments, providing the theoretical development of the model on one psychological need with the relative virtual game.;,citation_author=Irene Alice Chicchi Giglioli;,citation_author=Elena Parra;,citation_author=Georgina Cardenas-Lopez;,citation_author=Giuseppe Riva;,citation_author=Mariano Alcañiz Raya;,citation_editor=Mariano Alcañiz;,citation_editor=Stefan Göbel;,citation_editor=Minhua Ma;,citation_editor=Manuel Fradinho Oliveira;,citation_editor=Jannicke Baalsrud Hauge;,citation_editor=Tim Marsh;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.1007/978-3-319-70111-0_1;,citation_isbn=978-3-319-70110-3 978-3-319-70111-0;,citation_volume=10622;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_inbook_title=Serious Games;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Sex Difference in the Specificity of Sexual Arousal;,citation_abstract=Sexual arousal is category-specific in men; heterosexual men are more aroused by female than by male sexual stimuli, whereas homosexual men show the opposite pattern. There is reason to believe that female sexual arousal is organized differently. We assessed genital and subjective sexual arousal to male and female sexual stimuli in women, men, and postoperative male-to-female transsexuals. In contrast to men, women showed little category specificity on either the genital or the subjective measure. Both heterosexual and homosexual women experienced strong genital arousal to both male and female sexual stimuli. Transsexuals showed a category-specific pattern, demonstrating that category specificity can be detected in the neovagina using a photoplethysmographic measure of female genital sexual arousal. In a second study, we showed that our results for females are unlikely to be explained by ascertainment biases.

This review aims to bridge the gap between the treatment needs and experiences of pedohebephiles, and the services aiming to support them. Reviewers screened 1705 database hits and extracted findings from 22 qualitative, 15 quantitative, and 3 mixed-method studies on the treatment needs and experiences of pedohebephiles. Research suggests that this population experiences significant levels of distress, depression, and anxiety related to their sexual interest. Many individuals belonging to this population would seek (median = 42.3%), or have sought (median = 46.5%), treatment to cope with their sexual interest or with potential related mental health repercussions. Their experiences in treatment have been mixed, with some reporting positive experiences with empathic therapists and others reporting rejection. Most frequently, pedohebephiles report fear of exposure and rejection as barriers to seeking treatment, in addition to fear of the legal repercussions. The current study is the first to summarize and discuss previous findings on the treatment needs and experiences of pedohebephiles.

Today Artificial Intelligence is more oriented to several form of collective intelligence, also building robot simulators (hardware or software) to deeply understand collective behaviors in human beings and society as a whole. Modeling has also been crucial in the social sciences, to understand how complex systems can arise from simple rules. However, while engineers’ simulations can be performed in the physical world using robots, for social scientist this is impossible. For decades, researchers tried to improve simulations by endowing artificial agents with simple and complex rules that emulated human behavior also by using artificial intelligence (AI). To include human beings and their real intelligence within artificial societies is now the big challenge. We present an hybrid (humanartificial) platform where experiments can be performed by simulated artificial worlds in the following manner: 1) agents’ behaviors are regulated by the behaviors shown in Virtual Reality involving real human beings exposed to specific situations to simulate, and 2) technology transfers these rules into the artificial world.

Circles use volunteers to provide support for sex offenders living in the community. We searched 10 databases up to the end of 2013 and identified 3 relevant outcome studies. An additional 12 papers or reports were identified by searching reference lists, Google, and contacting key authors and Circles providers to obtain unpublished data. These 15 studies comprised one randomized controlled trial, three retrospective cohorts with matched controls, and 11 case series. The majority reported measures of recidivism, particularly reconviction.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Driving Simulator Sickness: An Evidence-Based Review of the Literature;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE. Guided by the Occupational Therapy Practice Framework: Domain and Process (2nd edition; American Occupational Therapy Association, 2008), we conducted an evidence-based review on simulator sickness (SS). METHOD. We searched Web of Science, PubMed, SafetyLit, Google Scholar, and recently published literature. We used the American Academy of Neurology’s classification criteria to extract data from 10 studies and assign each a level of 1–4, with “1” indicating the highest level of evidence. We grouped studies that addressed SS into client factors, context and environment factors, and activity demands. RESULTS. Client factors (i.e., older clients [$&amp;amp;amp;gt;$70 yr; Level B], women [Level B]) and context/environment factors (e.g., refresh rates, scenario design and duration, simulator configuration, and calibration; Level B) probably increase the rates of SS, whereas activity demands (vection, speed of driving, and postural instability; Level C) possibly contribute to SS. CONCLUSION. We classified factors contributing to SS and identified the need for randomized trials to identify causes of SS.;,citation_author=Sherrilene Classen;,citation_author=Megan Bewernitz;,citation_author=Orit Shechtman;,citation_publication_date=2011-03;,citation_cover_date=2011-03;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.5014/ajot.2011.000802;,citation_issn=0272-9490, 1943-7676;,citation_volume=65;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The American Journal of Occupational Therapy;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=TRANSSEXUALISM: A REVIEW OF ETIOLOGY, DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT;,citation_abstract=Transsexualism is considered to be the extreme end of the spectrum of gender identity disorders characterized by, among other things, a pursuit of sex reassignment surgery (SRS). The origins of transsexualism are still largely unclear. A first indication of anatomic brain differences between transsexuals and nontranssexuals has been found. Also, certain parental (rearing) factors seem to be associated with transsexualism. Some contradictory findings regarding etiology, psychopathology and success of SRS seem to be related to the fact that certain subtypes of transsexuals follow different developmental routes. The observations that psychotherapy is not helpful in altering a crystallized cross-gender identity and that certain transsexuals do not show severe psychopathology has led clinicians to adopt sex reassignment as a treatment option. In many countries, transsexuals are now treated according to the Standards of Care of the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association, a professional organization in the field of transsexualism. Research on postoperative functioning of transsexuals does not allow for unequivocal conclusions, but there is little doubt that sex reassignment substantially alleviates the suffering of transsexuals. However, SRS is no panacea. Psychotherapy may be needed to help transsexuals in adapting to the new situation or in dealing with issues that could not be addressed before treatment. © 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.;,citation_author=P T Cohen-Kettenis;,citation_author=L J G Gooren;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Personality Impairment in Male Pedophiles;,citation_abstract=Background: Despite the large body of literature on the psychological sequelae of childhood sexual abuse, the literature on the psychopathology of pedophiles is surprisingly underdeveloped. The present article explores the hypothesis that pedophiles evidence deficits in interpersonal functioning (lack of assertiveness and empathy, passive-aggressiveness) and in self-concept, which might contribute to the motivation for pedophilic acts, as well as elevated sociopathy, impulsivity, and propensity for cognitive distortions, which might underlie the inhibitory failure. Method: Twenty male heterosexual pedophiles (DSM-IV criteria) recruited from an outpatient clinic for sex offenders were compared with 24 demographically similar, healthy male controls using 3 personality instruments: the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory-II, the Dimensional Assessment of Personality ImpairmentQuestionnaire, and the Temperament and Character Inventory. Results: The data suggested that pedophiles have impaired interpersonal functioning, specifically, reduced assertiveness and elevated passiveaggressiveness, as well as impaired self-concept. Regarding disinhibitory traits, pedophiles demonstrated elevated sociopathy and propensity for cognitive distortions. Conclusion: Our data are consistent with previous reports of pathologic personality traits in pedophiles and lend support to a hypothesis that such pathology is related to both motivation for and failure to inhibit pedophilic behavior. Such information could potentially have important treatment implications. (J Clin Psychiatry 2002;63:912–919);,citation_author=Lisa J. Cohen;,citation_author=Pamela G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Patterns of Eye Movements When Male and Female Observers Judge Female Attractiveness, Body Fat and Waist-to-Hip Ratio;,citation_abstract=Behavioural studies of the perceptual cues for female physical attractiveness have suggested two potentially important features: body fat distribution [the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR)] and overall body fat [often estimated by the body mass index (BMI)]. However, none of these studies tell us directly which regions of the stimulus images inform observers’ judgments. Therefore, we recorded the eye movements of three groups of 10 male observers and three groups of 10 female observers, when they rated a set of 46 photographs of female bodies. The first sets of observers rated the images for attractiveness, the second sets rated for body fat and the third sets for WHR. If either WHR and/or body fat is used to judge attractiveness, then observers rating attractiveness should look at those areas of the body which allow assessment of these features, and they should look in the same areas when they are directly asked to estimate WHR and body fat. So we are able to compare the fixation patterns for the explicit judgments with those for attractiveness judgments and infer which features were used for attractiveness. Prior to group analysis of the eye-movement data, the locations of individual eye fixations were transformed into a common reference space to permit comparisons of fixation density at high resolution across all stimuli. This manipulation allowed us to use spatial statistical analysis techniques to show the following: (1) Observers’ fixations for attractiveness and body fat clustered in the central and upper abdomen and chest, but not the pelvic or hip areas, consistent with the finding that WHR had little influence over attractiveness judgments. (2) The pattern of fixations for attractiveness ratings was very similar to the fixation patterns for body fat judgments. (3) The fixations for WHR ratings were significantly different from those for attractiveness and body fat.;,citation_author=Piers L. Cornelissen;,citation_author=Peter J. B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Virtual Reality: A Use Case for Criminal Justice Practice;,citation_abstract=In recent years, virtual reality (VR) technology has convincingly demonstrated its potential for assessment, training, rehabilitation and treatment purposes in a variety of domains, including (mental) healthcare and education. This paper explores the possibilities for VR application within criminal justice practice. Criminological literature and literature of related disciplines on VR applications were reviewed with a special focus on risk assessment, correctional rehabilitation, and reintegration. We also devoted attention to the VR-based treatment of anxiety-related disorders among victims of crime. Literature shows that VR can provide safe learning environments that would otherwise involve risk, generate ethical and ecologically valid virtual alternatives for which real-life situations would be unethical to use, and develop environments that are impossible to create in the real life. These unique characteristics make VR a promising tool to expand the current toolbox of risk assessment instruments, and correctional rehabilitation and reintegration programs in important ways. Before implementing VR in criminal justice practice, an elementary understanding of both the advantages and disadvantages of VR technology is desirable but given a longstanding and effective VR tradition in other domains, the future of VR in criminal justice practice is bright.;,citation_author=Liza J.

A 16-item scale, the Coping Using Sex Inventory (CUSI), was developed to assess the presence of and the degree to which sex was used to deal with problematic situations. Sexual offenders consistently reported using sexual activities, both consenting and nonconsenting, as a coping strategy to deal with stressful and problematic situations. In the first study, when compared to nonsexual violent offenders, sexual offenders showed evidence of sexual preoccupation during adolescence, and this preoccupation was related to the latter use of sex as a coping strategy. In the second study, intimacy deficits and loneliness were related to greater use of sexual activity as a coping mechanism. The third study examined the psychometric properties of the CUSI. A factor analysis revealed 3 factors in the CUSI corresponding to consenting sexual themes, rape themes, and child sexual abuse themes. Sexual offenders reported higher use of each type of sexual activity to cope with stressful and difficult situations as compared to nonsexual offenders.

In the first RCT of a cognitive skills program for MDOs, we aimed to investigate whether participation in the Reasoning and Rehabilitation (R&amp;amp;amp;R) program reduced violence and antisocial behavior in this population. Method: Eighty-four male inpatients with a psychotic disorder and a history of violence were recruited from medium secure forensic hospitals. Participants were randomized to receive the R&amp;R program, consisting of 36 two-hour sessions, or treatment as usual (TAU). Incidents of violence and antisocial behavior (verbal aggression, substance use, and leave violations) were assessed during treatment and at 12-months posttreatment. Results: Relative to the TAU group, incident rates of verbal aggression and leave violations during the treatment period were significantly lower in the R&amp;R group; the effect on verbal aggression was maintained at 12-months posttreatment. Half of those randomized to receive R&amp;R did not complete treatment; post hoc analyses were therefore conducted to compare treatment responses in program completers and noncompleters. After controlling for psychopathic traits, incidents of violence, verbal aggression, and leave violations during treatment were significantly lower in program completers, and there were significant effects of program completion on verbal aggression and substance use at 12-months posttreatment. Conclusions: R&amp;R leads to a reduction in incidents of antisocial behavior in MDO populations, with potentially greater impact on those who complete treatment.;,citation_author=Alexis E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Improving User Experience of Virtual Health Assistants: Scoping Review;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Virtual assistants can be used to deliver innovative health programs that provide appealing, personalized, and convenient health advice and support at scale and low cost. Design characteristics that influence the look and feel of the virtual assistant, such as visual appearance or language features, may significantly influence users’ experience and engagement with the assistant. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to provide an overview of the experimental research examining how design characteristics of virtual health assistants affect user experience, summarize research findings of experimental research examining how design characteristics of virtual health assistants affect user experience, and provide recommendations for the design of virtual health assistants if sufficient evidence exists. METHODS: We searched 5 electronic databases (Web of Science, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and ACM Digital Library) to identify the studies that used an experimental design to compare the effects of design characteristics between 2 or more versions of an interactive virtual health assistant on user experience among adults. Data were synthesized descriptively. Health domains, design characteristics, and outcomes were categorized, and descriptive statistics were used to summarize the body of research. Results for each study were categorized as positive, negative, or no effect, and a matrix of the design characteristics and outcome categories was constructed to summarize the findings. RESULTS: The database searches identified 6879 articles after the removal of duplicates. We included 48 articles representing 45 unique studies in the review. The most common health domains were mental health and physical activity. Studies most commonly examined design characteristics in the categories of visual design or conversational style and relational behavior and assessed outcomes in the categories of personality, satisfaction, relationship, or use intention. Over half of the design characteristics were examined by only 1 study. Results suggest that empathy and relational behavior and self-disclosure are related to more positive user experience. Results also suggest that if a human-like avatar is used, realistic rendering and medical attire may potentially be related to more positive user experience; however, more research is needed to confirm this. CONCLUSIONS: There is a growing body of scientific evidence examining the impact of virtual health assistants’ design characteristics on user experience. Taken together, data suggest that the look and feel of a virtual health assistant does affect user experience. Virtual health assistants that show empathy, display nonverbal relational behaviors, and disclose personal information about themselves achieve better user experience. At present, the evidence base is broad, and the studies are typically small in scale and highly heterogeneous. Further research, particularly using longitudinal research designs with repeated user interactions, is needed to inform the optimal design of virtual health assistants.;,citation_author=Rachel G.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Saccade Preparation Signals in the Human Frontal and Parietal Cortices;,citation_abstract=Our ability to prepare an action in advance allows us to respond to our environment quickly, accurately, and flexibly. Here, we used event-related functional MRI to measure human brain activity while subjects maintained an active state of preparedness. At the beginning of each trial, subjects were instructed to prepare a pro- or antisaccade to a visual cue that was continually present during a long and variable preparation interval, but to defer the saccade’s execution until a go signal. The deferred saccade task eliminated the mnemonic component inherent in memory-guided saccade tasks and placed the emphasis entirely on advance motor preparation. During the delay while subjects were in an active state of motor preparedness, the blood oxygen level–dependent signal in the frontal cortex showed 1) a sustained elevation throughout the preparation interval; 2) a linear increase with increasing delay length; 3) a bias for contra- rather than ipsiversive movements; 4) greater activity when the specific metrics of the planned saccade were known compared with when they were not; and 5) increased activity when the saccade was directed toward an internal versus an external representation (i.e., anticue location). These findings support the hypothesis that both the human frontal and parietal cortices are involved in the spatial selection and preparation of saccades.;,citation_author=Clayton E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Brain Potentials in Affective Picture Processing: Covariation with Autonomic Arousal and Affective Report;,citation_abstract=Emotionally arousing picture stimuli evoked scalp-recorded event-related potentials. A late, slow positive voltage change was observed, which was significantly larger for affective than neutral stimuli. This positive shift began 200 – 300 ms after picture onset, reached its maximum amplitude :1 s after picture onset, and was sustained for most of a 6-s picture presentation period. The positive increase was not related to local probability of content type, but was accentuated for pictures that prompted increased autonomic responses and reports of greater affective arousal (e.g. erotic or violent content). These results suggest that the late positive wave indicates a selective processing of emotional stimuli, reflecting the activation of motivational systems in the brain. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Gaze-Fixation, Brain Activation, and Amygdala Volume in Unaffected Siblings of Individuals with Autism;,citation_abstract=Background: The broad autism phenotype includes subclinical autistic characteristics found to have a higher prevalence in unaffected family members of individuals with autism. These characteristics primarily affect the social aspects of language, communication, and human interaction. The current research focuses on possible neurobehavioral characteristics associated with the broad autism phenotype. Methods: We used a face-processing task associated with atypical patterns of gaze fixation and brain function in autism while collecting brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking in unaffected siblings of individuals with autism. Results: We found robust differences in gaze fixation and brain function in response to images of human faces in unaffected siblings compared with typically developing control individuals. The siblings’ gaze fixations and brain activation patterns during the face processing task were similar to that of the autism group and showed decreased gaze fixation along with diminished fusiform activation compared with the control group. Furthermore, amygdala volume in the siblings was similar to the autism group and was significantly reduced compared with the control group. Conclusions: Together, these findings provide compelling evidence for differences in social/emotional processing and underlying neural circuitry in siblings of individuals with autism, supporting the notion of unique endophenotypes associated with the broad autism phenotype.;,citation_author=Kim M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Coping Using Sex, Health-Related Behaviors, and Mental Health During COVID-19 Lockdown in the UK;,citation_abstract=Background: Peoples’ sexual behaviors have changed during the period of enforced COVID-19 social distancing, in some cases, to cope with negative feelings during lockdown. Research on coping using sex is relatively restricted to samples of men with a history of sexual offending, and it is unknown whether coping using sex is associated with health-related behaviors and mental health in the general population. Aim: We examined if coping using sex before and during lockdown was associated with adverse outcomes (i.e., self-perceived reduction in health-related behaviors and mental health) in a community sample. Hypotheses: We hypothesized that participants who reported greater use of sex to cope in the weeks preceding lockdown would show a greater decline in health-related behaviors and mental health during lockdown. Furthermore, that changes in coping using sex resulting from lockdown would account for further variance in the worsening of health-related behaviors and mental health. Methods: Participants were UK residents, aged 18–60 years, and fluent in English. 789 participants completed an online survey, providing demographic information, selfreported social distancing, loneliness, and coping using sex over a 14-day period during lockdown, and retrospectively preceding lockdown. Outcomes: Participants reported perceived changes in health-related behaviors and mental health symptomatology during lockdown compared to before the pandemic. They also self-reported levels of stress, anxiety and depression during lockdown. Results: Greater coping using sex prior to lockdown predicted positive change in healthrelated behaviors, for example, higher scores were associated with participants reporting having exercised and slept more. It was also associated with higher trait levels of anxiety, stress and depression during lockdown. Changes in coping using sex from before to during lockdown did not predict perceived changes in health related behaviors or mental health symptomatology. Conclusions: Overall, greater coping using sex prior to lockdown was associated with worse mental health symptomatology during lockdown (anxiety, depression and stress),;,citation_author=Natasha Daly;,citation_author=Andrew Jones;,citation_author=Carlo Garofalo;,citation_author=Kasia Uzieblo;,citation_author=Eric Robinson;,citation_author=Steven M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Considerations on Fantasy Use by Child Molesters and Exhibitionists;,citation_abstract=In many sex offender treatment programs, the examination and replacement of deviant fantasy use with appropriate fantasy use is a well-established practice. This practice is based on the assumption that sexual offenders use deviant masturbatory fantasies prior and after committing sexual offenses, but the data available to support this assumption is fairly limited. This study attempted to test the validity of this assumption by finding out whether a majority of exhibitionistic offenders and child molesters used deviant masturbatory fantasies prior and/or after their first offense. Data analysis from 57 child molesters and 25 exhibitionistic offenders indicate that a majority of these offenders used masturbatory deviant fantasies before and after their first offenses, but they tended to use significantly more deviant fantasies after they engage in their first actual offense. Content of deviant fantasies was examined in relation to victim specificity. There were no significant differences between the number of deviant fantasies reported about a specific victim versus the number of fantasies reported about a nonspecific victim. We found a significant positive correlation between the number of deviant fantasies reported and the number of months spent in treatment by child molesters, but not by exhibitionistic offenders. Some tentative explanations for these findings are offered, but further elucidation is necessary.;,citation_author=Andrei Dandescu;,citation_author=Roger Wolfe;,citation_publication_date=2003-10;,citation_cover_date=2003-10;,citation_year=2003;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/107906320301500406;,citation_issn=1079-0632, 1573-286X;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sexual Abuse;">

This study aims to understand online sex offenders’ behaviors by modeling the factors associated with their use of technological data protection and anonymity preservation strategies. The data is based on a sample of 199 men involved in crimes related to the use of child pornography or sexual solicitation of minors online. The analytical strategy based on the use of an artificial neural network (ANN), a machine-learning system, identified two trends. First, those who displayed problematic substance use and sexual thoughts and fantasies as well as behaviors reported to be preoccupying did not use specific strategies to avoid police detection. Second, two combinations of factors predict use of police anti-detection strategy, suggesting that the criminal expertise of online sex offenders is manifested in two different patterns: those building on existing knowledge, and those learning skills through previous judicial experience.;,citation_author=David Décary-Hétu;,citation_author=Julien Chopin;,citation_author=Sarah Paquette;,citation_author=Francis Fortin;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_language=en-US;">

This article provides a brief history of the development and goals of EBPs in medicine and mental health, and a review of the earnest efforts of researchers within the field to establish treatment approaches with sexual abusers as evidence-based. An appraisal of the current status of EBP’s with sexual abusers is provided. Although there have been improvements in the methodological quality of treatment outcome research with sexual abusers, divergent opinions about treatment effectiveness remain, and the field has not yet agreed on a system or set of criteria for what constitutes “evidence.” We contend that clinical practice has been influenced as much, or more, by new paradigms that are intuitively meaningful and perceived as needed than it has by what has been determined to be scientifically efficacious. This trend and other processes in our field that seem to be slowing the development of EBPs with sexual abusers are discussed.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Pilot Development of Virtual Stimuli Depicting Affective Dispositions for Penile Plethysmography Assessment of Sex Offenders;,citation_abstract=There are concerns regarding the reliability, realism, and validity of stimulus materials used in the assessment of sexual interests among sex offenders. This article explores new stimulus materials for use with penile plethysmography (PPG) assessments. First, this paper presents a pilot study where undergraduate students rated virtual characters (male and female) on perceived age. In addition, the materials developed are unique in that they depict the characters exhibiting varying affective dispositions, including neutral, fearful, sad, joyful, and seductive. Participants in the first study were also asked to identify the affective disposition of the virtual characters, and results suggest that affective disposition was largely perceived as intended, especially in terms of identifying the general emotional valence of the affective dispositions (i.e., positive versus negative). In a second pilot study, we used the computer-generated images to measure sexual arousal responses in a group of non-deviant males recruited in the community. Responses measured through penile plethysmography suggest participants responded to the stimuli as expected, as the greatest amount of sexual arousal was recorded when participants were shown the adult female character. In addition, participants responded with significant arousal only when the adult female character was depicted as sexually open ( joyful or seductive), rather than sexually closed or neutral. Results suggest these materials may discriminate sexual interests if applied within clinical forensic assessment of sex offenders.;,citation_author=Elissa Dennis;,citation_author=Joanne-Lucine Rouleau;,citation_author=Patrice Renaud;,citation_author=Kévin Nolet;,citation_author=Chantal Saumur;,citation_publication_date=2014-12;,citation_cover_date=2014-12;,citation_year=2014;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.3138/cjhs.2529;,citation_issn=1188-4517, 2291-7063;,citation_volume=23;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=The Canadian Journal of Human Sexuality;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Self-Reported Sexual Real-World Consequences of Sex Doll Use;,citation_abstract=It is a growing concern that the use of sex dolls and robots could affect human sexuality. This concern has led to a ban of child-like sex dolls in several countries and a call to ban adult-like sex dolls and robots by some scholars. However, empirical data is largely missing supporting this claim. Here, we present retro spective self-reported quantitative and qualitative data of a large sample (N = 224, 90.5% men, Mean age = 31 years, SD = 14.2) of teleiophilic (i.e., sexual orientation toward adults) and pedo-hebephilic participants. Using an online survey, we found that users reported an overall reduction in sexualityrelated behaviors (e.g., porn consumption or visiting of sex workers) in response to doll ownership. Users in a relationship with a human were less affected by doll use, while those in a relationship with a doll reported greater effects. Interestingly, pedo-hebephilic users reported a greater reduction of sexual compulsivity compared to teleiophilic participants following doll use. Additionally, pedo-hebephilic participants more often reported acting out of illegal sexual fantasies with their dolls and a loss of interest in (sexual) intimacy with real children through doll use in the qualitative data. These self-reported data challenge the view that doll use is dangerously affecting human sexuality and instead suggest that dolls may be used as a sexual outlet for potentially dangerous and illegal (sexual) fantasies.;,citation_author=Jeanne C.

Nevertheless, it is assumed that pedophilic sexual impulses can be controlled from acting out. To prevent CSA an outpatient treatment facility for people with pedophilia was founded in Zurich, Switzerland in 2021. The program focuses on the prevention of CSA and improvement of quality of life, incorporating empirically validated treatment principles, such as the Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) model and the Good Lives Model (GLM). Within the initial 24-month 142 individuals sought help, 46 individuals (mean age 36.0  12.4 years) completed the assessment phase, two-thirds suffered from psychiatric comorbidities, and 67.4% reported sexual delinquency. The high drop-out rate was predominantly due to ongoing criminal proceedings, or other mental health conditions. Overall patients at this facility generally sought treatment voluntarily, leading to good treatment adherence, with severe self-harm being more prevalent than acute danger to others.

Here, using a naturalistic and racquet-based interception task in a virtual environment, we demonstrate that subjects make accurate predictions of visual target motion, even when targets follow trajectories determined by the complex dynamics of physical interactions and the head and body are unrestrained. Furthermore, we found that, following a change in ball elasticity, subjects were able to accurately adjust their prebounce predictions of the ball’s post-bounce trajectory. This suggests that prediction is guided by experience-based models of how information in the visual image will change over time.;,citation_author=G. Diaz;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Eye Tracking of Men’s Preferences for Female Breast Size and Areola Pigmentation;,citation_abstract=Sexual selection via male mate choice has often been implicated in the evolution of permanently enlarged breasts in women. While questionnaire studies have shown that men find female breasts visually attractive, there is very little information about how they make such visual judgments. In this study, we used eye-tracking technology to test two hypotheses: (1) that larger breasts should receive the greatest number of visual fixations and longest dwell times, as well as being rated as most attractive; (2) that lightly pigmented areolae, indicative of youth and nubility, should receive most visual attention and be rated as most attractive. Results showed that men rated images with mediumsized or large breasts as significantly more attractive than small breasts. Images with dark and medium areolar pigmentation were rated as more attractive than images with light areolae. However, variations in breast size had no significant effect on eye-tracking measures (initial visual fixations, number of fixations, and dwell times). The majority of initial fixations during eye-tracking tests were on the areolae. However, areolar pigmentation did not affect measures of visual attention. While these results demonstrate that cues indicative of female sexual maturity (large breasts and dark areolae) are more attractive to men, patterns of eye movements did not differ based on breast size or areolar pigmentation. We conclude that areolar pigmentation, as well as breast size, plays a significant role in men’s judgments of female attractiveness. However, fine-grained measures of men’s visual attention to these morphological traits do not correlate, in a simplistic way, with their attractiveness judgments.;,citation_author=Barnaby J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Eye-Tracking of Men’s Preferences for Waist-to-Hip Ratio and Breast Size of Women;,citation_abstract=Studies of human physical traits and mate preferences often use questionnaires asking participants to rate the attractiveness of images. Female waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), breast size, and facial appearance have all been implicated in assessments by men of female attractiveness. However, very little is known about how men make fine-grained visual assessments of such images. We used eye-tracking techniques to measure the numbers of visual fixations, dwell times, and initial fixations made by men who viewed front-posed photographs of the same woman, computer-morphed so as to differ in her WHR (0.7 or 0.9) and breast size (small, medium, or large). Men also rated these images for attractiveness. Results showed that the initial visual fixation (occurring within 200 ms from the start of each 5 s test) involved either the breasts or the waist. Both these body areas received more first fixations than the face or the lower body (pubic area and legs). Men looked more often and for longer at the breasts, irrespective of the WHR of the images. However, men rated images with an hourglass shape and a slim waist (0.7 WHR) as most attractive, irrespective of breast size. These results provide quantitative data on eye movements that occur during male judgments of the attractiveness of female images, and indicate that assessments of the female hourglass figure probably occur very rapidly.;,citation_author=Barnaby J.

Etablierte Beurteilungskriterien sind unzureichend operationalisiert. Ziel und Methoden Vorhandene Kriterien sollen von Experten verschiedener Berufsgruppen hinsichtlich ihrer Reliabilität überprüft werden. Hierzu bewerteten 14&nbsp;Experten die Kriterien zweier Kriterienkataloge anhand zweier Fallvignetten (siehe Electronic Supplementary Material). Ergebnisse und Diskussion Die Interrater-Reliabilität (IRR) bezogen auf die Kriterien von Briken und Müller [3, 4] war höher als die der bisher etablierten Kriterien von Boetticher et&nbsp;al. [2]. Die Auswertung der subjektiven Wichtigkeit der Kriterien beider Beurteilungsskalen zeigte, dass alle Kriterien als mindestens durchschnittlich ausschlaggebend bewertet wurden. Es kann daher zunächst sinnvoll sein, beide Kriterienkataloge für eine höhere Transparenz in den Beurteilungsprozess miteinzubeziehen und dieses Vorgehen in weiteren Studien zu untersuchen. , Abstract Background For the assessment of criminal responsibility in the context of sexual delinquency, the evaluation of the severity of a&nbsp;paraphilic disorder and the ability to be controlled are of particular importance. Established assessment criteria are insufficiently operationalized. Aim and methods The existing criteria were tested by experts of various professional groups with respect to the reliability. For this purpose, 14&nbsp;experts assessed the criteria of 2 different sets of criteria based on 2 case vignettes (see electronic supplementary material). Results and conclusion The interrater reliability (IRR) with reference to the criteria of Briken and Müller was higher than the previously established criteria of Boetticher et&nbsp;al. The evaluation of the subjective importance of the criteria of both assessment scales showed that all criteria were rated as at least of average importance. It could thus be useful to initially include both sets of criteria for a greater transparency in the assessment process and to investigate this procedure in further studies.;,citation_author=S.

Methods Following the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses (PRISMA), 25 qualified studies contributed 35 independent effect sizes. Results Full participation in a program significantly reduced the recidivism rate. Participant age was a significant moderator of heterogeneity. Those aged over 18 have lower recidivism rates. Interventions that fully follow the Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) design principles achieved similar results to those that did not. Recidivism rates increase more than 12 months after the program ends. Conclusions The effectiveness of community correctional programs varies depending on the participant’s age.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural Mechanism of Unconscious Perception of Surprised Facial Expression;,citation_abstract=Previous functional neuroimaging studies have uncovered partly separable neural substrates for perceiving different facial expressions presented below the level of conscious awareness. However, as one of the six basic emotions, the neural mechanism of unconsciously perceiving surprised faces has not yet been investigated. Using a backward masking procedure, we studied the neural activities in response to surprised faces presented below the threshold of conscious visual perception by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Eighteen healthy adults were scanned while viewing surprised faces, which presented for 33 ms and immediately “masked” by a neutral face for 467 ms. As a control, they viewed masked happy or neutral faces as well. In comparison to both control conditions, masked surprised faces yielded significantly greater activation in the parahippocampal gyrus and fusiform gyrus, which associated previously with novelty detection. In the present study, automatic activation of these areas to masked surprised faces was investigated as a function of individual differences in the ability of identifying and differentiating one’s emotions, as assessed by the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The correlation results showed that, the subscale, Difficulty Identifying Feelings, was negatively correlated with the neural response of these areas to masked surprised faces, which suggest that decreased activation magnitude in specific brain regions may reflect increased difficulties in recognizing one’s emotions in everyday life. Additionally, we confirmed activation of the right amygdala and right thalamus to the masked surprised faces, which was previously proved to be involved in the unconscious emotional perception system.;,citation_author=Xujun Duan;,citation_author=Qian Dai;,citation_author=Qiyong Gong;,citation_author=Huafu Chen;,citation_publication_date=2010-08;,citation_cover_date=2010-08;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.04.021;,citation_issn=10538119;,citation_volume=52;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=NeuroImage;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Balance Training Using a Virtual-Reality System in Older Fallers;,citation_abstract=Poor balance is considered a challenging risk factor for falls in older adults. Therefore, innovative interventions for balance improvement in this population are greatly needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a new virtual-reality system (the Balance Rehabilitation Unit [BRU]) on balance, falls, and fear of falling in a population of community-dwelling older subjects with a known history of falls. In this study, 60 community-dwelling older subjects were recruited after being diagnosed with poor balance at the Falls and Fractures Clinic, Nepean Hospital (Penrith, NSW, Australia). Subjects were randomly assigned to either the BRU-training or control groups. Both groups received the usual falls prevention care. The BRU-training group attended balance training (two sessions/week for 6 weeks) using an established protocol. Change in balance parameters was assessed in the BRU-training group at the end of their 6-week training program. Both groups were assessed 9 months after their initial assessment (month 0). Adherence to the BRU-training program was 97%. Balance parameters were significantly improved in the BRU-training group (P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.01). This effect was also associated with a significant reduction in falls and lower levels of fear of falling (P $&amp;lt;$ 0.01). Some components of balance that were improved by BRU training showed a decline after 9 months post-training. In conclusion, BRU training is an effective and well-accepted intervention to improve balance, increase confidence, and prevent falls in the elderly.;,citation_author=Gustavo Duque;,citation_author=Derek Boersma;,citation_author=Griselda Loza-Diaz;,citation_author=Sanobar Hassan;,citation_author=Hamlet Suarez;,citation_author=Dario Geisinger;,citation_author=Pushpa Suriyaarachchi;,citation_author=Anita Sharma;,citation_author=Oddom Demontiero;,citation_publication_date=2013;,citation_cover_date=2013;,citation_year=2013;,citation_doi=10.2147/CIA.S41453;,citation_issn=1176-9092;,citation_pmid=23467506;,citation_volume=8;,citation_journal_title=Clinical Interventions in Aging;">

FDEs’ opinions were significantly more accurate than controls, providing further evidence of FDE expertise. Both control and FDE subjects looked at signature features in a very similar way and the difference in the accuracy of their opinions can be accounted for by different cognitive processing of the visual information that they extract from the images. In a separate experiment the FDEs re-examined a reordered set of the same 32 questioned signatures. In this phase each signature was presented for only 100 msec to test if eye movements are relevant in forming opinions; performance significantly dropped, but not to chance levels indicating that the examination process comprises a combination of both global and local feature extraction strategies.;,citation_author=Adrian G.

Moreover, there were age-group differences in misattributions of expressions, in that young participants were more likely to label disgusted faces as angry, whereas older adults were more likely to label angry faces as disgusted. In addition to effects of emotion expressed in faces, age of faces affected visual inspection of faces: Both young and older participants spent more time looking at own-age than other-age faces, with longer looking at own-age faces predicting better own-age expression identification. Thus, cues used in expression identification may shift as a function of emotion and age of faces, in interaction with age of participants.;,citation_author=Natalie C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Prevalence of Mental Disorders in Incarcerated Contact Sexual Offenders;,citation_abstract=Objective: Mental disorders in sexual offenders are relevant in terms of risk assessment and psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatment. Methods: The present cross-sectional study was conducted between 2001 and 2017 and included 1511 sexual offenders who were assessed at the Federal Evaluation Center for Sexual and Violent Offenders in the Austrian Prison System. All sexual offenders were assessed with the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I (SCID I) and Axis II disorders (SCID II). Results: N = 1250 (92.9%) sexual offenders were diagnosed with a mental disorder, whereby the great majority received multiple diagnoses. The most frequently found disorders were alcohol misuse (40.0%), paraphilic (43.3%), and personality disorders (53.6%) with a special emphasis on Cluster B personality disorders (47.8%). While sexual offenders against children were more likely to be diagnosed with paraphilic disorders, sexual offenders against adults were more likely to be diagnosed with a personality disorder. Conclusion: Prevalence rates of mental disorders in sexual offenders are considerable. Besides specific risk reducing treatment, the psychological and social sequelae of the mental disorder have to be addressed in interventions in order to reach an effective and sustainable risk reduction.;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Cognitive Model of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder;,citation_abstract=Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common reaction to traumatic events. Many people recover in the ensuing months, but in a signicant subgroup the symptoms persist, often for years. A cognitive model of persistence of PTSD is proposed. It is suggested that PTSD becomes persistent when individuals process the trauma in a way that leads to a sense of serious, current threat. The sense of threat arises as a consequence of: (1) excessively negative appraisals of the trauma and/or its sequelae and (2) a disturbance of autobiographical memory characterised by poor elaboration and contextualisation, strong associative memory and strong perceptual priming. Change in the negative appraisals and the trauma memory are prevented by a series of problematic behavioural and cognitive strategies. The model is consistent with the main clinical features of PTSD, helps explain several apparently puzzling phenomena and provides a framework for treatment by identifying three key targets for change. Recent studies have provided preliminary support for several aspects of the model. # 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.;,citation_author=Anke Ehlers;,citation_author=David M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cognitive Therapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: Development and Evaluation;,citation_abstract=The paper describes the development of a cognitive therapy (CT) program for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that is based on a recent cognitive model (Behav. Res. Therapy 38 (2000) 319). In a consecutive case series, 20 PTSD patients treated with CT showed highly significant improvement in symptoms of PTSD, depression and anxiety. A subsequent randomized controlled trial compared CT (N $\frac{1}{4}$ 14) and a 3-month waitlist condition (WL, N $\frac{1}{4}$ 14). CT led to large reductions in PTSD symptoms, disability, depression and anxiety, whereas the waitlist group did not improve. In both studies, treatment gains were well maintained at 6month follow-up. CT was highly acceptable, with an overall dropout rate of only 3%. The intent-to-treat effect sizes for the degree of change in PTSD symptoms from pre to post-treatment were 2.70–2.82 (self-report), and 2.07 (assessor-rated). The controlled effect sizes for CT versus WL post-treatment scores were 2.25 (self-report) and 2.18 (assessor-rated). As predicted by the cognitive model, good treatment outcome was related to greater changes in dysfunctional post-traumatic cognitions. Patient characteristics such as comorbidity, type of trauma, history of previous trauma, or time since the traumatic event did not predict treatment response, however, low educational attainment and low socioeconomic status were related to better outcome.;,citation_author=Anke Ehlers;,citation_author=David M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparing the Static-99R and the Child Pornography Offender Risk Tool (CPORT) in Two Canadian Samples Adjudicated of Child Sexual Exploitation Material Offenses;,citation_abstract=Static-99R is a widely used, extensively researched, and validated risk assessment measure for sexual recidivism among men. However, individuals who have committed child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) offenses but who have not produced CSEM or directly offended against a victim do not meet the scoring criteria. In a combined sample of 484 men convicted of CSEM offenses in two provinces (Ontario and Quebec) in Canada, the discrimination and calibration of the Static-99R was examined. We also examined the convergent validity of the Static-99R with the more recently developed, purpose built, Child Pornography Offender Risk Tool (CPORT). Static-99R and CPORT total scores were moderately and positively correlated (r = 0.63). Static-99R predicted sexual, CSEM, and violent recidivism for both the full sample, as well as those who met Static-99R scoring criteria. Static-99R did not predict sexual or violent recidivism in CSEM cases that did not meet Static-99R scoring criteria. CPORT was a better predictor of any sexual recidivism and CSEM recidivism compared to the Static-99R. Calibration analyses suggested the Static-99R underestimated the number of sexual recidivists observed in our sample. The current study suggests that Static-99R can be valid for some men with CSEM offenses, however, caution is recommended for using the sexual recidivism norms for CSEM offending men because they may underestimate their actual sexual reoffending rate.;,citation_author=Angela W.

A multivariate general linear model found a mixed offender profile that was similar to internet offenders rather than contact offenders. The contact group demonstrated lower victim empathy, a greater level of prooffending attitudes, an externalized locus of control, more assertiveness, a diminished ability to relate to fictional characters, and greater impulsivity than the internet and mixed offender groups. The mixed offender group demonstrated a higher level of empathic concern than the other two groups. The mixed offender group could also be distinguished from the internet group by increased personal distress and perspectivetaking ability. A discriminant function analysis highlighted the key linear factor distinguishing between the groups to be one relating to offense-supportive attitudes and identification with fictional characters. A second factor was related to higher levels of empathic concern and poor self-management.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Placebo Effects in Psychotherapy: A Framework;,citation_abstract=The issue of placebo response and the extent of its effect on psychotherapy is complex for two specific reasons: i) Current standards for drug trials, e.g., true placebo interventions, double-blinding, cannot be applied to most psychotherapy techniques, and ii) some of the “nonspecific effects” in drug therapy have very specific effects in psychotherapy, such as the frequency and intensity of patient–therapist interaction. In addition, different psychotherapy approaches share many such specific effects (the “dodo bird verdict”) and lack specificity with respect to therapy outcome. Here, we discuss the placebo effect in psychotherapy under four aspects: a) nonspecific factors shared with drug therapy (context factors); b) nonspecific factors shared among all psychotherapy traditions (common factors); c) specific placebo-controlled options with different psychotherapy modalities; and d) nonspecific control options for the specific placebo effect in psychotherapy. The resulting framework proposes that the exploration and enumeration of context factors, common factors, and specific factors contributes to the placebo effects in psychotherapy.;,citation_author=Paul Enck;,citation_author=Stephan Zipfel;,citation_publication_date=2019-06;,citation_cover_date=2019-06;,citation_year=2019;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00456;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_volume=10;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;">

First, we replicate the suppression of microsaccades with a minimum rate about 150 ms after cue onset. Second, as a new finding we observe microsaccadic enhancement with a maximum rate about 350 ms after presentation of the cue. Third, we find a modulation of the orientation towards the cue direction. These multiple influences of visual attention on microsaccades accentuate their role for visual information processing.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reduction of Risk Factors for Pedophilic Sexual Offending;,citation_abstract=Introduction: Exploratory analysis of characteristics and reduction of risk factors for child sexual abuse (CSA) in a sample treated in the Prevention Projects Dunkelfeld Hannover and Regensburg. Aim: To evaluate a treatment program aimed at reducing dynamic risk factors (DRF) for CSA. Methods: Using a psychometric test battery based on self-report questionnaires, intergroup analysis between treatment group (TG, n $\frac{1}{4}$ 35), treatment refusers (TR, n $\frac{1}{4}$ 51), and drop-out group (DO, n $\frac{1}{4}$ 14) was conducted with pretreatment data. Intragroup analysis compared data of TG from pre- and posttreatment. The test battery included sociodemographic and sociosexual data, as well as questionnaires measuring DRF. Main Outcome Measure: This study investigated effects of treatment on pedophilic men who are at risk for offending and observed reductions in important risk factors for CSA. Results: TG, TR (consisting of persons who were offered but refused therapy), and DO did not differ regarding sociodemographic and sociosexual variables before therapy. There were no significant differences in education, relationship status, living solitarily, and being a father/stepfather. TR and DO lived farther away from treatment site than TG. In the TG, a reduction in offense-supportive attitudes, coping self-efficacy deficits, and child identification were revealed at second assessment. In TG no participants started the consumption of child abuse content during the course of the study. Clinical Implications: Future treatment concepts should focus on the reduction of empirically relevant risk factors for child sexual offending. Strength &amp;amp;amp; Limitations: The present article is the first that compares TG to TR and DO before assessment regarding DRF and sociosexual variables. Moreover, it is only the second study that investigated treatment effects on a population of pedophilic men who are at risk for offending. These preliminary findings are limited by moderate group size and a missing control group. Conclusion: A reduction in some but not all assessed risk factors for sexual offending against minors could be seen within the time frame of therapy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine Learning and Risk Assessment: Random Forest Does Not Outperform Logistic Regression in the Prediction of Sexual Recidivism;,citation_abstract=Actuarial risk assessment instruments (ARAIs) are widely used for the prediction of recidivism in individuals convicted of sexual offenses. Although many studies supported the use of ARAIs because they outperformed unstructured judgments, it remains an ongoing challenge to seek potentials for improvement of their predictive performance. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, like random forests, are able to detect patterns in data useful for prediction purposes without explicitly programming them. In contrast to logistic regression, random forests are able to consider nonlinear effects between risk factors and the criterion in order to enhance predictive validity. Therefore, the current study aims to compare conventional logistic regression analyses with the random forest algorithm on a sample of N = 511 adult male individuals convicted of sexual offenses. Data was collected at the Federal Evaluation Center for Violent and Sexual Offenders (FECVSO) in Austria within a prospective-longitudinal research design and participants were followed-up for an average of M = 8.2 years. The Static-99, containing static risk factors, and the Stable-2007, containing stable dynamic risk factors, were included as predictors. The results demonstrated no superior predictive performance of the random forest compared to logistic regression; furthermore, methods of interpretable machine learning did not point to any robust nonlinear effects. Altogether, results supported the statistical use of logistic regression for the development and clinical application of ARAIs.;,citation_author=Sonja Etzler;,citation_author=Felix D.

The current study compares groups of Internet (CP) and CC sexual offenders, with each group’s sexual offending history exclusively confined to its offense category. T tests were used to conduct bivariate comparisons of group demographics and criminal histories. Rates of recidivism were examined using survival curves and Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results showed significant differences on demographic and criminal history variables, with CP offenders demonstrating a lower frequency of prior criminal offending and substance abuse, and higher rates of preincarceration employment and level of education. Rates of recidivism were significantly different between the two groups, with CP offenders showing lower rates of re-offense for most measures of recidivism. When controlling for background characteristics and the timing of the event, CC offenders were at much greater risk for having an arrest for a new crime or a non-sexual violent crime than CP offenders.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pointwise Confidence Intervals for a Survival Distribution with Small Samples or Heavy Censoring;,citation_abstract=We propose a beta product confidence procedure (BPCP) that is a non-parametric confidence procedure for the survival curve at a fixed time for right-censored data assuming independent censoring. In such situations, the Kaplan–Meier estimator is typically used with an asymptotic confidence interval (CI) that can have coverage problems when the number of observed failures is not large, and/or when testing the latter parts of the curve where there are few remaining subjects at risk. The BPCP guarantees central coverage (i.e. ensures that both one-sided error rates are no more than half of the total nominal rate) when there is no censoring (in which case it reduces to the Clopper–Pearson interval) or when there is progressive type II censoring (i.e. when censoring only occurs immediately after failures on fixed proportions of the remaining individuals). For general independent censoring, simulations show that the BPCP maintains central coverage in many situations where competing methods can have very substantial error rate inflation for the lower limit. The BPCP gives asymptotically correct coverage and is asymptotically equivalent to the CI on the Kaplan–Meier estimator using Greenwood’s variance. The BPCP may be inverted to create confidence procedures for a quantile of the underlying survival distribution. Because the BPCP is easy to implement, offers protection in settings when other methods fail, and essentially matches other methods when they succeed, it should be the method of choice.;,citation_author=Michael P.

The idea that pedophilia is an orientation is also redefined.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural Correlates of the Empathic Perceptual Processing of Realistic Social Interaction Scenarios Displayed from a First-Order Perspective;,citation_abstract=The neural processing of impulsive behavior is a central topic in various clinical and nonclinical contexts. To investigate neural and behavioral correlates of the empathic processing of complex social scenarios, especially considering ecological validity of the experimental procedure, we developed and investigated a video stimulus inventory. It includes realistic neutral, social-positive, and reactive–aggressive action scenarios. Short video-clips showing these social scenarios from a first-person perspective triggering different emotional states were presented to a non-clinical sample of 20 young adult male participants during fMRI measurements. Both affective interaction conditions (social-positive and reactive–aggressive) were contrasted against a neutral baseline condition and against each other. Behavioral evaluation data largely confirmed the validity of the emotion-inducing stimulus material. Reactive–aggressive and social-positive interaction scenarios produced widely overlapping fMRI activation patterns in hetero-modal association cortices, but also in subcortical regions, such as the peri-aqueductal gray. Reactive–aggressive compared to social-positive scenarios yielded a more anterior distribution of activations in pre-motor and inferior frontal brain regions associated to motor-preparation and inhibitory control processing as well as in the insula associated to painand/or aversion-processing. We argue that there are both principally common neural networks recruited for the processing of reactive–aggressive and social-positive scenarios, but also exclusive network parts in particular involved depending on individual socialization.;,citation_author=T.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effectiveness of Child Sexual Abuse Prevention Programs on Knowledge Acquisition: A Meta-Analytical Study;,citation_abstract=BACKGROUND: Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a type of maltreatment considered a global health problem. CSA is a traumatic experience with important consequences for the victim’s health. It is essential to report the effectiveness of CSA prevention programs to offer society useful tools to combat this abuse. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the effectiveness of CSA prevention programs on the knowledge acquisition based on comparing pre- and post-treatment changes, and also if their effectiveness is related to program-related and methodological variables. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTINGS: Standardised mean change (with studies that report pre-post program measures) of the effectiveness of CSA prevention programs published between 2014 and 2021 was carried out. METHODS: The general effectiveness of these programs and whether the results were influenced by program-related variables (the duration, the target population, participants’ age, or the type of intervention) or by methodology-related factors (the agent who taught them, the geographical area where they were carried out or the way the programs were evaluated) were analysed. A total of 43 samples analysing knowledge about CSA as a dependent variable were included. RESULTS: The results reported a combined effect size considered large (dMR&nbsp;=&nbsp;-0.96, 95&nbsp;% CI [-1.10, -0.82], p&nbsp;$&amp;amp;amp;lt;~$.001).

During the last decade, virtual reality has emerged as a technology that is especially suitable not only for the assessment of body image disturbances but also for its treatment. Indeed, several virtual environment-based software systems have been developed for this purpose. Furthermore, virtual reality seems to be a good alternative to guided imagery and in vivo exposure, and is therefore very useful for studies that require exposure to life-like situations but which are difficult to conduct in the real world.

Objectives: We examined the effect of nicotine deprivation on different aspects of attentional biases for smoking-related cues. Methods: Smokers’ eye movements to smoking-related and control pictures were assessed during a visual probe task under deprived and non-deprived conditions. Results: When deprived, smokers maintained their gaze for longer on smoking-related than control cues, relative to when non-deprived. Deprivation also increased craving and pleasantness ratings of smoking cues. Across both deprived and non-deprived conditions, smokers were more likely to shift their gaze towards smoking cues and were faster to respond to probes replacing smoking cues, relative to non-smoking cues, but these attentional bias measures were not significantly affected by the deprivation manipulation. Conclusions: Results suggest a selective effect of deprivation on the maintenance of attention on smokingrelated cues.;,citation_author=Matt Field;,citation_author=Karin Mogg;,citation_author=Brendan P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural Processes Associated With Antisaccade Task Performance Investigated With Event-Related fMRI;,citation_abstract=One of the hallmarks of cognitive control is the suppression of prepotent but inappropriate responses. Here we used event-related functional MRI to measure functional brain activation during a stimulus-response incompatibility task. Subjects were instructed before a stimulus appeared either to look at the stimulus (prosaccade) or to look away from the stimulus (antisaccade). Eye movements were recorded so that functional brain activation could be grouped into prosaccades, correct antisaccades, and errors (saccades toward the stimulus on antisaccade trials). Correct antisaccade trials were associated with significantly more activation in frontal and parietal cortical areas compared with prosaccade trials during the late preparatory period before stimulus appearance. Correct antisaccades evoked more activation than errors in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and presupplementary eye fields during this period. No significant differences were found for any comparisons early in the preparatory period. Our data suggest that the preparation of an antisaccade activates a large frontal and parietal network that may be involved in presetting the oculomotor system for the antisaccade task. These findings indicate that a large network of frontal and posterior areas is modulated during the latter component of the preparatory period on antisaccade compared with prosaccade trials. The results further suggest that the activation level of frontal cortical areas before stimulus presentation is associated with subjects’ performance in the antisaccade task. In contrast, we found no areas that were more active for correct antisaccades than prosaccades or for correct antisaccades than error antisaccades during the stimulus-response period. In fact, a number of posterior cortical areas and a few areas in the superior frontal lobe were more active during the stimulus-response period on prosaccade trials than on antisaccade trials. Error antisaccades showed a larger activation in the ACC during the stimulus-response period compared with correct antisaccades.;,citation_author=Kristen A. Ford;,citation_author=Herbert C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Individuals under Voluntary Treatment with Sexual Interest in Minors: What Risk Do They Pose?;,citation_abstract=Child Sexual Abuse (CSA) and the production, use, and distribution of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) are key threats to children’s mental health. From the perspective of indicated prevention, it can be assumed that some persons with a sexual interest in children commit such unreported crimes. Accordingly, the German Network kein Täter werden (meaning do not offend) has implemented a confidential treatment service for persons with a sexual interest in minors who voluntarily seek therapy, might or might not have offended but have not yet been detected or have fulfilled all legal requirements (here referred to as non-forensic individuals). However, this offer has been questioned for investing resources in a group which critics consider as low risk. The following study addresses the question of recidivism risks for CSA or viewing CSAM among non-forensic individuals. We found significantly higher rates of CSA/CSAM in our participants’ history compared to a German study on a representative sample of males. Regarding CSAM, the recidivism rate of 39% was found to be 11 times higher than the expected recidivism rate based on previous publications. Regarding CSA, the recidivism rate of 14% was not significantly different from the expected rate reported for subjects with a conviction for a sexual contact offense. Among various risk instruments, only the CPORT with CASIC rating was able to predict CSA (AUC = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.55, 0.82) and CSAM (AUC = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.53, 0.73) among individuals with a history of CSAM, but with poor discrimination. We conclude that a large proportion of our sample poses a substantial risk and therefore treatment resources are well invested. However, further studies are needed to improve risk assessment among non-forensic clients.;,citation_author=Fritjof Franqué;,citation_author=Ralf Bergner-Koether;,citation_author=Stefanie Schmidt;,citation_author=Jan Pellowski;,citation_author=Jan Peters;,citation_author=Göran Hajak;,citation_author=Peer Briken;,citation_publication_date=2023-11;,citation_cover_date=2023-11;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1277225;,citation_volume=14;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Sensory Information and Prior Experience on Direct Subjective Ratings of Presence;,citation_abstract=We report three experiments using a new form of direct subjective presence evaluation that was developed from the method of continuous assessment used to assess television picture quality. Observers were required to provide a continuous rating of their sense of presence using a handheld slider. The first experiment investigated the effects of manipulating stereoscopic and motion parallax cues within video sequences presented on a 20 in. stereoscopic CRT display. The results showed that the presentation of both stereoscopic and motion parallax cues was associated with higher presence ratings. One possible interpretation of Experiment 1 is that CRT displays that contain the spatial cues of stereoscopic disparity and motion parallax are more interesting or engaging. To test this, observers in Experiment 2 rated the same stimuli first for interest and then for presence. The results showed that variations in interest did not predict the presence ratings obtained in Experiment 1. However, the subsequent ratings of presence differed significantly from those obtained in Experiment 1, suggesting that prior experience with interest ratings affected subsequent judgments of presence. To test this, Experiment 3 investigated the effects of prior experience on presence ratings. Three groups of observers rated a training sequence for interest, presence, and 3-Dness before rating the same stimuli as used for Experiments 1 and 2 for presence. The results demonstrated that prior ratings sensitize observers to different features of a display resulting in different presence ratings. The implications of these results for presence evaluation are discussed, and a combination of more-refined subjective measures and a battery of objective measures is recommended.;,citation_author=Jonathan Freeman;,citation_author=S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Virtual Reality in the Assessment, Understanding, and Treatment of Mental Health Disorders;,citation_abstract=Mental health problems are inseparable from the environment. With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety ( n = 192), schizophrenia ( n = 44), substance-related disorders ( n = 22) and eating disorders ( n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology’s ability to create new realities. VR may merit the level of attention given to neuroimaging.;,citation_author=D. Freeman;,citation_author=S. Reeve;,citation_author=A. Robinson;,citation_author=A. Ehlers;,citation_author=D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hormones, Genes and the Structure of Sexual Arousal;,citation_abstract=Despite the inherent difficulty of connecting individual genes with integrated mammalian behaviors, it has been determined that a series of genes are turned on by estrogenic hormones acting in forebrain. Their products are, in turn, facilitatory for female reproductive behaviors such as lordosis. The causal routes by which two genes contribute to the control of lordosis behavior, the classical estrogen receptor gene (ER-a) and a thyroid hormone (TH) receptor gene (TR-b), have been delineated. Beyond the mechanisms underlying the expression of concrete, specific natural behaviors, lies the question of sexual motivation. Required as an intervening variable to explain fluctuations in natural behaviors in the face of constant stimuli, motivational states have both general and specific features. Most theoretical and experimental approaches toward the general aspects of motivation have depended heavily on concepts of “arousal.” Sexual arousal is likely to depend both on very general, broadly distributed neuronal influences and on specific affiliative and sexual tendencies. Is “general arousal” a monolithic, undifferentiated process? In no way can a review at this time settle such issues, but the reasons behind six new experimental approaches to these questions are described. © 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Behavioral Monitoring of Sexual Offenders Against Children in Virtual Risk Situations: A Feasibility Study;,citation_abstract=The decision about unsupervised privileges for sexual offenders against children (SOC) is one of the most difficult decisions for practitioners in forensic high-security hospitals. Facing the possible consequences of the decision for the society, a valid and reliable risk management of SOCs is essential. Some risk management approaches provide frameworks for the construction of relevant future risk situations. Due to ethical reasons, it is not possible to evaluate the validity of constructed risk situations in reality. The aim of the study was to test if behavioral monitoring of SOCs in high-immersive virtual risk situations provides additional information for risk management. Six SOCs and seven non-offender controls (NOC) walked through three virtual risk situations, confronting the participant with a virtual child character. The participant had to choose between predefined answers representing approach or avoidance behavior. Frequency of chosen answers were analyzed in regards to knowledge of the participants about coping skills and coping skills focused during therapy. SOCs and NOCs behavior differed only in one risk scenario. Furthermore, SOCs showed in 89% of all cases a behavior not corresponding to their own belief about adequate behavior in comparable risk situations. In 62% of all cases, SOCs behaved not corresponding to coping skills they stated that therapists focused on during therapy. In 50% of all cases, SOCs behaved in correspondence to coping skills therapists stated that they focused on during therapy. Therapists predicted the behavior of SOCs in virtual risk situations incorrect in 25% of all cases. Thus, virtual risk scenarios provide the possibility for practitioners to monitor the behavior of SOCs and to test their decisions on unsupervised privileges without endangering the community. This may provide additional information for therapy progress. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the predictive and ecological validity of behavioral monitoring in virtual risk situations for real life situations.;,citation_author=Peter Fromberger;,citation_author=Sabrina Meyer;,citation_author=Kirsten Jordan;,citation_author=Jürgen L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Diagnostic Accuracy of Eye Movements in Assessing Pedophilia;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Given that recurrent sexual interest in prepubescent children is one of the strongest single predictors for pedosexual offense recidivism, valid and reliable diagnosis of pedophilia is of particular importance. Nevertheless, current assessment methods still fail to fulfill psychometric quality criteria. Aims. The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of eye-movement parameters in regard to pedophilic sexual preferences. Method. Eye movements were measured while 22 pedophiles (according to ICD-10 F65.4 diagnosis), 8 nonpedophilic forensic controls, and 52 healthy controls simultaneously viewed the picture of a child and the picture of an adult. Fixation latency was assessed as a parameter for automatic attentional processes and relative fixation time to account for controlled attentional processes. Main Outcome Measures. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses, which are based on calculated agepreference indices, were carried out to determine the classifier performance. Cross-validation using the leave-oneout method was used to test the validity of classifiers. Results. Pedophiles showed significantly shorter fixation latencies and significantly longer relative fixation times for child stimuli than either of the control groups. Classifier performance analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.902 for fixation latency and an AUC = 0.828 for relative fixation time. The eye-tracking method based on fixation latency discriminated between pedophiles and non-pedophiles with a sensitivity of 86.4% and a specificity of 90.0%. Cross-validation demonstrated good validity of eye-movement parameters. Conclusions. Despite some methodological limitations, measuring eye movements seems to be a promising approach to assess deviant pedophilic interests. Eye movements, which represent automatic attentional processes, demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Eye Movements in Pedophiles: Automatic and Controlled Attentional Processes While Viewing Prepubescent Stimuli.;,citation_abstract=Recent theories in sexuality highlight the importance of automatic and controlled attentional processes in viewing sexually relevant stimuli. The model of Spiering and Everaerd (2007) assumes that sexually relevant features of a stimulus are preattentively selected and automatically induce focal attention to these sexually relevant aspects. Whether this assumption proves true for pedophiles is unknown. It is aim of this study to test this assumption empirically for people suffering from pedophilic interests. Twenty-two pedophiles, 8 nonpedophilic forensic controls, and 52 healthy controls simultaneously viewed the picture of a child and the picture of an adult while eye movements were measured. Entry time was assessed as a measure of automatic attentional processes and relative fixation time in order to assess controlled attentional processes. Pedophiles demonstrated significantly shorter entry time to child stimuli than to adult stimuli. The opposite was the case for nonpedophiles, as they showed longer relative fixation time for adult stimuli, and, against all expectations, pedophiles also demonstrated longer relative fixation time for adult stimuli. The results confirmed the hypothesis that pedophiles automatically selected sexually relevant stimuli (children). Contrary to all expectations, this automatic selection did not trigger the focal attention to these sexually relevant pictures. Furthermore, pedophiles were first and longest attracted by faces and pubic regions of children; nonpedophiles were first and longest attracted by faces and breasts of adults. The results demonstrated, for the first time, that the face and pubic region are the most attracting regions in children for pedophiles.;,citation_author=Peter Fromberger;,citation_author=Kirsten Jordan;,citation_author=Henrike Steinkrauss;,citation_author=Jakob Herder;,citation_author=Georg Stolpmann;,citation_author=Birgit Kröner-Herwig;,citation_author=Jürgen Leo Müller;,citation_publication_date=2013-05;,citation_cover_date=2013-05;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=2;,citation_doi=10.1037/a0030659;,citation_issn=1939-1846, 0021-843X;,citation_volume=122;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Abnormal Psychology;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Initial Orienting Towards Sexually Relevant Stimuli: Preliminary Evidence from Eye Movement Measures;,citation_abstract=It has been proposed that sexual stimuli will be processed in a comparable manner to other evolutionarily meaningful stimuli (such as spiders or snakes) and therefore elicit an attentional bias and more attentional engagement (Spiering and Everaerd, In E. Janssen (Ed.), The psychophysiology of sex (pp. 166–183). Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2007). To investigate early and late attentional processes while looking at sexual stimuli, heterosexual men (n = 12) viewed pairs of sexually preferred (images of women) and sexually non-preferred images (images of girls, boys or men), while eye movements were measured. Early attentional processing (initial orienting) was assessed by the number of first fixations and late attentional processing (maintenance of attention) was assessed by relative fixation time. Results showed that relative fixation time was significantly longer for sexually preferred stimuli than for sexually non-preferred stimuli. Furthermore, the first fixation was more often directed towards the preferred sexual stimulus, when simultaneously presented with a non-sexually preferred stimulus. Thus, the current study showed for the first time an attentional bias to sexually relevant stimuli when presented simultaneously with sexually irrelevant pictures. This finding, along with the discovery that heterosexual men maintained their attention to sexually relevant stimuli, highlights the importance of investigating early and late attentional processes while viewing sexual stimuli. Furthermore, the current study showed that sexually relevant stimuli are favored by the human attentional system.;,citation_author=Peter Fromberger;,citation_author=Kirsten Jordan;,citation_author=Jakob Herder;,citation_author=Henrike Steinkrauss;,citation_author=Rebekka Nemetschek;,citation_author=Georg Stolpmann;,citation_author=Jürgen Leo Müller;,citation_publication_date=2012-08;,citation_cover_date=2012-08;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s10508-011-9816-3;,citation_issn=0004-0002, 1573-2800;,citation_volume=41;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Archives of Sexual Behavior;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=@myTabu—A Placebo Controlled Randomized Trial of a Guided Web-Based Intervention for Individuals Who Sexually Abused Children and Individuals Who Consumed Child Sexual Exploitation Material: A Clinical Study Protocol;,citation_abstract=Background: There is a high demand for evidence-based and cost-effective treatment concepts for convicted individuals who sexually abused children (ISAC) and individuals who consumed child sexual exploitation material (ICCSEM) under community supervision (CS). The @myTabu-consortium developed a guided web-based intervention for convicted ISAC and ICCSEM under CS consisting of six online modules targeting psychological meaningful risk factors. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of this guided web-based intervention in reducing dynamic risk factors and the risk to re-offend compared to a placebo condition. Furthermore, these dynamic risk factors are measured before and after every module to evaluate their individual effectiveness to reduce the respective risk factor as well as risk to re-offend. This clinical trial protocol describes the planned methods as well as the intervention concept. Methods: The methodological design is a placebo controlled randomized add-on trial ( N = 582) with follow-ups at 8 points in time. The placebo condition controls for attention and expectation effects and comprises the same amount of modules with a comparable temporal effort as the experimental intervention. The trial is conducted as an add-on to community supervision as usually done. Primary outcomes are dynamic risk factors assessed by self-report risk assessment tools and officially recorded re-offenses. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge, the study is the first to compare the (cost-) effectiveness of a guided web-based intervention for convicted ISAC and ICCSEM under community supervision against a placebo condition.

This article describes the diagnostic criteria and potential differential diagnoses as well as epidemiological and etiological findings. From an etiological point of view multifactorial mechanisms are currently considered to be responsible especially genetic factors, learning theoretical and neurobiological factors. Psychotherapeutic and pharmaceutical treatment options will be discussed. According to the current state of knowledge cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy is the method of choice in the treatment of pedophilia and has demonstrated positive treatment effects in meta-analyses regarding relapse prevention.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Avatars in Clinical Psychology: A Framework for the Clinical Use of Virtual Humans;,citation_abstract=Early applications of virtual reality (VR) technology in psychological assessment, treatment, and research have yielded promising results. In particular, an increasing number of studies analyze the unique features of the experience made by patients during their exposure to virtual environments. However, the majority of these studies explore how patients navigate in the virtual spaces and interact with virtual objects. Only a few of them investigate the features of inhabited virtual environments, where real people and autonomous virtual humans are able to interact and to cooperate. In particular, there is a lack of discussion of the role that such autonomous virtual humans could have in VR-aided psychotherapy. The main goal of this paper is to identify a framework for future research in this area. Three levels of analysis are identified. The purpose of the first two levels is the identification of the key “physical” features (e.g., appearance, structure) and “internal” characteristics (e.g., behavior, degree of autonomy, perceptual capabilities) needed by an effective simulation. The third level is concerned with the evaluation of the interaction characteristics required for a successful relationship between the patient and the virtual human.;,citation_author=A.

This review indicates that literature and research examining sexual offenders’ cognitions has benefited a great deal from adopting internalist approaches to cognition. From this review of the literature, implications are presented for how such knowledge may be used in practical applications with sexual offenders (i.e. a collaborative enquiry of sexual offenders’ cognition).

Despite this, however, relatively few researchers and professionals have conducted research of direct relevance for treating female child sexual offenders (FCSOs). In this review, we synthesize and update the available literature examining FCSOs’ socio-demographic features, available typological distinctions, and research investigating the potential treatment needs of FCSOs. Our evaluation of the latest research suggests that researchers have spent the majority of their attention examining either socio-demographic or typological features of FCSOs at the expense of developing research investigating FCSOs’ treatment requirements. We suggest that future research in this area should concentrate on developing research and adapting methods established with male sexual offenders to enable adequate and informative investigation of FCSOs’ treatment needs.

In this research, eye movement (EM) tracking assessed biases in specific component processes of visual attention (i.e., orientation, detection, maintenance and disengagement of gaze) in relation to bodyrelated stimuli among 20 weight dissatisfied (WD) and 20 weight satisfied young women. Eye movements were recorded while participants completed a dot-probe task that featured fatness-neutral and thinness-neutral word pairs. Compared to controls, WD women were more likely to direct their initial gaze toward fatness words, had a shorter mean latency of first fixation on both fatness and thinness words, had longer first fixation on fatness words but shorter first fixation on thinness words, and shorter total gaze duration on thinness words. Reaction time data showed a maintenance bias towards fatness words among the WD women. In sum, results indicated WD women show initial orienting, speeded detection and initial maintenance biases towards fat body words in addition to a speeded detection e avoidance pattern of biases in relation to thin body words. In sum, results highlight the importance of the utility of EM-tracking as a means of identifying subtle attentional biases among weight dissatisfied women drawn from a non-clinical setting and the need to assess attentional biases as a dynamic process.

As technology advances, internet child sexual abuse material (I/CAM) offences increase in pertinence to forensic assessment and treatment. A new proposal in I/CAM therapeutics, the Estimated Risk of Internet Child Sexual Offending (ERICSO) is a framework for individualised, risk-relevant treatment formulation based on identified risk factors. An international scoping review of I/CAM treatment programmes was conducted prior to elucidating our proposed treatment model for I/CAM offenders. Combining risk-relevant and compassionate therapies, we propose a treatment framework based on the risk–needs–responsivity model and relevant factors, recognising diversity of I/CAM offenders. Incorporating proven constructs in offender assessment and treatment with specific application to the I/CAM offender cohort, the ERICSO assists professionals to formulate risk-relevant, individual therapy and set meaningful goals.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Content-Induced Delay With Double-Entendre Words;,citation_abstract=Seventy-three men and 72 women made lexical decisions to target words that followed sentences constructed so that the last word was a sexual double-entendre. Prime target relatedness, erotic versus nonerotic target, stimulus onset asynchrony, and participant’s gender were varied in a between-subjects design. A second analysis that substituted sentence context for prime target relationship also was conducted. Data were collected on the emotionality and social acceptability of priming sentences and target words. Results revealed that, as with previous research on neutral words, prime target relatedness facilitated lexical decisions. Additionally, there was evidence of slowing in making lexical decisions when erotic material was presented or was part of a contextual bias. This delay was accentuated in women. A model that proposes that sexual words evoke a more complex processing sequence is presented. The model suggests that appraisal and checking or editing mechanisms, which are accentuated in women, help explain the phenomenon.;,citation_author=James H Geer;,citation_author=Jeffrey S Melton;,citation_language=en-US;">

Displays comprised a high-contrast square-wave grating, defined as target by its orientation, presented alone (unilateral) or with a similar distractor of orthogonal orientation in the opposite hemifield (bilateral displays). The target appeared unpredictably on the left or right, precluding anticipatory attention to one side. We found greater activation in target-contralateral superior occipital gyrus for unilateral than for bilateral displays, indicating suppression of the target’s visual representation by distractor presence despite the competing distractor projecting to a different occipital hemisphere. Several frontal and parietal regions showed greater activation for bilateral than unilateral trials, suggesting involvement in on-line attentional selection. This was particularly pronounced for regions in bilateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), which also showed greater functional coupling with occipital cortex specifically on bilateral trials that required selection plus some repetition-suppression effects when target side was repeated, but again only on bilateral trials requiring selection. Our results indicate that competition between visual stimuli in opposite hemifields can influence occipital cortex, and implicate IPS in resolution of this competition by selection.;,citation_author=Joy J.

However, it is still unclear whether initial engagement of attention toward threat or difficulties to disengage from threat is the underlying mechanism. We used eye-tracking to investigate how quickly fear-relevant pictures are identified and whether they distract from the allocation of attention toward neutral targets. Pairs of fearrelevant and neutral pictures were presented to 18 high and 16 low spider-fearful participants. They were instructed to either fixate on a target or to fixate on the opposite picture, while eye movements were monitored continuously. Overall, fear-relevant targets were fixated more quickly than neutral targets. Spider-fearful participants had longer latencies when they had to identify the fear-relevant but fixate the neutral picture. Thus, attentional allocation toward threat was not specifically enhanced in fearful participants. Instead, they had difficulties to disengage attention from fear-relevant information.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Clinical Characteristics Associated with Paedophilia and Child Sex Offending – Differentiating Sexual Preference from Offence Status;,citation_abstract=Abstract Contrary to public perception, child sex offending (CSO) and paedophilia are not the same. Only half of all cases of CSO are motivated by paedophilic preference, and a paedophilic preference does not necessarily lead to CSO. However, studies that investigated clinical factors accompanying and contributing to paedophilia so far mainly relied on paedophiles with a history of CSO. The aim of this study was to distinguish between factors associated with sexual preference (paedophile versus non-paedophile) and offender status (with versus without CSO). Accordingly, a 2 (sexual preference)  2 (offender status) factorial design was used for a comprehensive clinical assessment of paedophiles with and without a history of CSO ( n = 83, n = 79 respectively), child sex offenders without paedophilia ( n = 32) and healthy controls ( n = 148). Results indicated that psychiatric comorbidities, sexual dysfunctions and adverse childhood experiences were more common among paedophiles and child sex offenders than controls. Offenders and non-offenders differed in age, intelligence, educational level and experience of childhood sexual abuse, whereas paedophiles and non-paedophiles mainly differed in sexual characteristics (e.g., additional paraphilias, onset and current level of sexual activity). Regression analyses were more powerful in segregating offender status than sexual preference (mean classification accuracy: 76% versus 68%). In differentiating between offence- and preference-related factors this study improves clinical understanding of both phenomena and may be used to develop scientifically grounded CSO prevention and treatment programmes. It also highlights that some deviations are not traceable to just one of these two factors, thus raising the issue of the mechanism underlying both phenomena.;,citation_author=Hannah Gerwinn;,citation_author=Simone Weiß;,citation_author=Gilian Tenbergen;,citation_author=Till Amelung;,citation_author=Carina Födisch;,citation_author=Alexander Pohl;,citation_author=Claudia Massau;,citation_author=Jonas Kneer;,citation_author=Sebastian Mohnke;,citation_author=Christian Kärgel;,citation_author=Matthias Wittfoth;,citation_author=Stefanie Jung;,citation_author=Krassimira Drumkova;,citation_author=Kolja Schiltz;,citation_author=Martin Walter;,citation_author=Klaus M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Motives for Pornography Use and Women’s Sexual Wellbeing: Insights from a 42-Country Study;,citation_abstract=Background and aims Despite a growing body of research on pornography use among women, there is a lack of understanding of the problematic versus non-problematic nature. The current study aimed to investigate the relationship between women’s motivations for pornography use and sexual wellbeing using a cross-sectional, self-report survey design among participants from 42 countries. Methods The total sample included 82,243 participants, of whom 46,874 (57.0%) identified as women and were analyzed. The participants’ age averaged at M = 29.67 years, with a standard deviation of SD = 10.11. Participants were asked to complete a questionnaire assessing their motivations for pornography use, as well as measures of sexual functioning, sexual desire, and sexual satisfaction. Results Study results suggest that across cultures, women’s motivations for pornography use are associated with their sexual wellbeing. Specifically, when women reported using pornography for their own pleasure or sexual curiosity, it was associated with fewer sexual functioning problems and higher sexual desire. Conversely, when women reported using pornography due to a lack of sexual satisfaction in their relationships, it was associated with more sexual functioning problems. Discussion and conclusions These findings highlight the need to consider the multifaceted nature of pornography use among women, including the usage motives, to fully understand associations with sexual wellbeing. Additionally, the study emphasizes the importance of conducting further research utilizing longitudinal designs, to establish the directionality between pornography use motivations and sexual wellbeing among women.;,citation_author=Ateret Gewirtz-Meydan;,citation_author=Hagit Feder;,citation_author=Léna Nagy;,citation_author=Mónika Koós;,citation_author=Shane W.

Little is known about possible differences between convicted and non-convicted pedophilic CSOs and why only some become known to the judicial system. This investigation takes a closer look at the two sides of “child sexual offending” by focusing on clinical and neurobiological characteristics of convicted and non-convicted pedophilic CSOs as presented in the Neural Mechanisms Underlying Pedophilia and sexual offending against children (NeMUP)*-study. Seventy-nine male pedophilic CSOs were examined, 48 of them convicted. All participants received a thorough clinical examination including the structured clinical interview (SCID), intelligence, empathy, impulsivity, and criminal history. Sixty-one participants (38 convicted) underwent an inhibition performance task (Go/No-go paradigm) combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Convicted and non-convicted pedophilic CSOs revealed similar clinical characteristics, inhibition performances, and neuronal activation. However, convicted subjects’ age preference was lower (i.e., higher interest in prepubescent children) and they had committed a significantly higher number of sexual offenses against children compared to non-convicted subjects. In conclusion, sexual age preference may represent one of the major driving forces for elevated rates of sexual offenses against children in this sample, and careful clinical assessment thereof should be incorporated in every preventive approach.;,citation_author=Charlotte Gibbels;,citation_author=Christopher Sinke;,citation_author=Jonas Kneer;,citation_author=Till Amelung;,citation_author=Sebastian Mohnke;,citation_author=Klaus Michael Beier;,citation_author=Henrik Walter;,citation_author=Kolja Schiltz;,citation_author=Hannah Gerwinn;,citation_author=Alexander Pohl;,citation_author=Jorge Ponseti;,citation_author=Carina Foedisch;,citation_author=Inka Ristow;,citation_author=Martin Walter;,citation_author=Christian Kaergel;,citation_author=Claudia Massau;,citation_author=Boris Schiffer;,citation_author=Tillmann H.

The aim of this study was to evaluate a psycho-educational program for community dwelling users of child sexual exploitation material (CSEM). A total of 92 adult male participants completed selfreport measures at pre and post. A subset of participants also completed measures after a follow-up period. Results suggested benefits across depression, anxiety, and stress; social competency, including locus of control and self-esteem; and distorted attitudes. Furthermore, these effects remained 8 to 12 weeks following program completion. Our results suggest that CSEM users are amenable to treatment in the community and that there are beneficial outcomes in affective and interpersonal functioning following psycho-education.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=ORIGINAL RESEARCH—INTERSEX AND GENDER IDENTITY DISORDERS: Specific Cerebral Activation Due to Visual Erotic Stimuli in Male-to-Female Transsexuals Compared with Male and Female Controls: An fMRI Study;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Transsexuals harbor the strong feeling of having been born to the wrong sex. There is a continuing controversial discussion of whether or not transsexualism has a biological representation. Differences between males and females in terms of functional imaging during erotic stimuli have been previously described, revealing genderspecific results. Aim. Therefore, we postulated that male-to-female (MTF) transsexuals may show specific cerebral activation differing from their biological gender. Main Outcome Measure. Cerebral activation patterns during viewing of erotic film excerpts in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods. Twelve male and 12 female heterosexual volunteers and 12 MTF transsexuals before any treatment viewed erotic film excerpts during fMRI. Additionally, subjective rating of sexual arousal was assessed. Statistics were performed using the Statistical Parametric Mapping software. Results. Significantly enhanced activation for men compared with women was revealed in brain areas involved in erotic processing, i.e., the thalamus, the amygdala, and the orbitofrontal and insular cortex, whereas no specific activation for women was found. When comparing MTF transsexuals with male volunteers, activation patterns similar to female volunteers being compared with male volunteers were revealed. Sexual arousal was assessed using standard rating scales and did not differ significantly for the three groups. Conclusions. We revealed a cerebral activation pattern in MTF transsexuals compared with male controls similar to female controls compared with male controls during viewing of erotic stimuli, indicating a tendency of female-like cerebral processing in transsexualism.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Contextual Fear Conditioning in Virtual Reality Is Affected by 5HTTLPR and NPSR1 Polymorphisms: Effects on Fear-Potentiated Startle;,citation_abstract=The serotonin (5-HT) and neuropeptide S (NPS) systems are discussed as important genetic modulators of fear and sustained anxiety contributing to the etiology of anxiety disorders. Sustained anxiety is a crucial characteristic of most anxiety disorders which likely develops through contextual fear conditioning. This study investigated if and how genetic alterations of the 5-HT and the NPS systems as well as their interaction modulate contextual fear conditioning; specifically, function polymorphic variants in the genes coding for the 5-HT transporter (5HTT) and the NPS receptor (NPSR1) were studied. A large group of healthy volunteers was therefore stratified for 5HTTLPR (S+ vs. LL carriers) and NPSR1 rs324981 (T+ vs. AA carriers) polymorphisms resulting in four genotype groups (S+/T+, S+/AA, LL/T+, LL/AA) of 20 participants each. All participants underwent contextual fear conditioning and extinction using a virtual reality (VR) paradigm. During acquisition, one virtual office room (anxiety context, CXT+) was paired with an unpredictable electric stimulus (unconditioned stimulus, US), whereas another virtual office room was not paired with any US (safety context, CXT-). During extinction no US was administered. Anxiety responses were quantified by fear-potentiated startle and ratings. Most importantly, we found a gene  gene interaction on fear-potentiated startle. Only carriers of both risk alleles (S+/T+) exhibited higher startle responses in CXT+ compared to CXT-. In contrast, anxiety ratings were only influenced by the NPSR1 polymorphism with AA carriers showing higher anxiety ratings in CXT+ as compared to CXT-. Our results speak in favor of a two level account of fear conditioning with diverging effects on implicit vs. explicit fear responses. Enhanced contextual fear conditioning as reflected in potentiated startle responses may be an endophenotype for anxiety disorders.;,citation_author=Evelyn Glotzbach-Schoon;,citation_author=Marta Andreatta;,citation_author=Andreas Reif;,citation_author=Heike Ewald;,citation_author=Christian Troger;,citation_author=Christian Baumann;,citation_author=Jurgen Deckert;,citation_author=Andreas Muhlberger;,citation_author=Paul Pauli;,citation_publication_date=2013-04;,citation_cover_date=2013-04;,citation_year=2013;,citation_doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2013.00031;,citation_issn=1662-5153;,citation_pmid=23630477;,citation_volume=7;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Randomized Controlled Pilot Study of a Brief Web-Based Mindfulness Training;,citation_abstract=Background: Mindfulness has been shown to be effective in treating various medical and mental problems. Especially its incorporation in cognitive-behavioural interventions has improved long-term outcomes of those treatments. It has also been shown, that brief mindfulness-based trainings are effective in reducing distress. There have been few web-based interventions incorporating mindfulness techniques in their manual and it remains unclear whether a brief web-based mindfulness intervention is feasible. Methods: Out of 50 adults (different distress levels; exclusion criteria: $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 18 years, indication of psychotic or suicidal ideation in screening) who were recruited via e-mail and screened online, 49 were randomized into an immediate 2-weeks-treatment group (N = 28) or a waitlist-control group (N = 21), starting with a 2-week delay. Distress (BSI), perceived stress (PSQ), mindfulness (FMI), as well as mood and emotion regulation (PANAS/SEK-27) were measured at pre-, post- and 3-month follow-up (3MFU). Intention-to-treat analyses using MI for missing data and per-protocol analyses ($\geq$ 50% attendance) were performed. Results: 26 participants of the treatment group completed post-measures. Most measures under ITT-analysis revealed no significant improvement for the treatment group, but trends with medium effect sizes for PSQ (d = 0.46) and PANASneg (d = 0.50) and a small, non-significant effect for FMI (d = 0.29). Per-protocol analyses for persons who participated over 50% of the time revealed significant treatment effects for PSQ (d = 0.72) and PANASneg (d = 0.77). Comparing higher distressed participants with lower distressed participants, highly distressed participants seemed to profit more of the training in terms of distress reduction (GSI, d = 0.85). Real change (RCI) occurred for PSQ in the treatment condition (OR = 9). Results also suggest that participants continued to benefit from the training at 3MFU. Conclusion: This study of a brief web-based mindfulness training indicates that mindfulness can be taught online and may improve distress, perceived stress and negative affect for regular users. Although there were no significant improvements, but trends, for most measures under ITT, feasibility of such a program was demonstrated and also that persons continued to use techniques of the training in daily life.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Digital Health Applications (DiGAs) on a Fast Track: Insights From a Data-Driven Analysis of Prescribable Digital Therapeutics in Germany From 2020 to Mid-2024;,citation_abstract=Background: This study aimed to analyze the rapidly evolving ecosystem of digital health applications (Digitale Gesundheitsanwendung; DiGAs) in Germany, spurred by the 2019 Digital Healthcare Act. With over 73 million people in Germany now having access to DiGAs, these prescribable digital health apps and web-based applications represent a substantial stride in health care modernization, supporting both patients and health care providers with digital solutions for disease management and care improvement. Objective: Through a data-driven approach, this research aimed to unpack the complexities of DiGA market dynamics, economic factors, and clinical evidence, offering insights into their impact over the past years. Methods: The analysis draws from a range of public data sources, including the DiGA directory, statutory health insurance reports, app store feedback, and clinical study results. Results: As of July 1, 2024, there are 56 DiGAs listed by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte), divided into 35 permanently and 21 preliminarily listed applications. Our findings reveal that a majority of DiGAs extend beyond the intended 1-year period to achieve permanent listing, reflecting the extensive effort required to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Economic analysis uncovered a dynamic pricing landscape, with initial prices ranging from approximately  to  (=US $1.07), averaging at a median of  for a 3-month DiGA prescription. Following negotiations or arbitration board decisions, prices typically see a 50% reduction, settling at a median of . Prescription data offer valuable insights into DiGA acceptance, with total prescriptions jumping from around 41,000 in the first period to 209,000 in the latest reporting period. The analysis of the top 15 DiGAs, representing 82% of the total prescriptions, shows that these best-performing apps receive from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 77 daily prescriptions, with native apps and early market entrants achieving higher rates. Clinical evidence from all 35 permanently listed DiGAs indicates a uniform preference for randomized controlled trials to validate primary end points, with no noteworthy use of alternative study designs encouraged in the Digital Healthcare Act and related regulations. Moreover, all evaluated DiGAs focused on medical benefits, with health status improvement as a key end point, suggesting an underuse of patient-relevant structural and procedural improvement in demonstrating health care impact. Conclusions: This study highlights the growth and challenges within the DiGA sector, suggesting areas for future research, such as the exploration of new study designs and the potential impact of patient-relevant structural and procedural improvements. For DiGA manufacturers, the strategic advantage of early market entry is emphasized.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Artifact Removal in Co-Registered EEG/fMRI by Selective Average Subtraction;,citation_abstract=Objective: Co-registration of EEG (electroencephalogram) and fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) remains a challenge due to the large artifacts induced on the EEG by the MR (magnetic resonance) sequence magnetic fields. Thus, we present an algorithm, based on the average-subtraction method, which is able to correct EEG data for gradient and pulse artifacts. Methods: MR sequence timing parameters are estimated from the EEG data and both slice and volume artifact templates are subtracted from the data. A clustering algorithm is proposed to account for the variability of the pulse artifact. Results: The algorithm is able to keep the spontaneous EEG as well as visual evoked potentials (VEPs), while removing gradient and pulse artifacts with only a subtraction of selectively averaged data. In the frequency domain, the artifact frequencies are strongly attenuated. Estimated MR sequence time parameters showed that the correction is extremely sensitive to the slice time value. Pulse artifact clustering showed that most of the variability is due to the time jitter of the pulse artifact markers. Conclusions: Selective subtraction of averages in combination with proper time alignment is enough to remove most of the MR-induced artifacts. Significance: Clean EEG can be obtained from raw signals that are corrupted by MR-induced artifacts during simultaneous EEG–fMRI scanning without using dedicated hardware to synchronize EEG and fMRI clocks.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Efficacy of Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy in the Treatment of PTSD: A Systematic Review;,citation_abstract=The use of Information and Communication Technologies, such as virtual reality, has been employed in the treatment of anxiety disorders with the goal of augmenting exposure treatment, which is already considered to be the first-line treatment for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). To evaluate the efficacy of virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) in the treatment of PTSD, we performed a systematic review of published articles using the following electronic databases: Web of Science, PubMed, PsycINFO, and PILOTS. Eligibility criteria included the use of patients diagnosed with PTSD according to DSM-IV, the use of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and the use of virtual reality for performing exposure. 10 articles were selected, seven of which showed that VRET produced statistically significant results in comparison to the waiting list. However, no difference was found between VRET and exposure treatment. Of these 10, four were randomized, two were controlled but not randomized and four were non-controlled. The majority of the articles used head-mounted display virtual reality (VR) equipment and VR systems specific for the population that was being treated. Dropout rates do not seem to be lower than in traditional exposure treatment. However, there are a few limitations. Because this is a new field of research, there are few studies in the literature. There is also a need to standardize the number of sessions used. The randomized studies were analyzed to assess the quality of the methodology, and important deficiencies were noted, such as the non-use of intent-to- treat-analysis and the absence of description of possible concomitant treatments and comorbidities. Preliminary data suggest that VRET is as efficacious as traditional exposure treatment and can be especially useful in the treatment of patients who are resistant to traditional exposure.;,citation_author=Raquel Gonçalves;,citation_author=Ana Lúcia Pedrozo;,citation_author=Evandro Silva Freire Coutinho;,citation_author=Ivan Figueira;,citation_author=Paula Ventura;,citation_editor=Mel Slater;,citation_publication_date=2012-12;,citation_cover_date=2012-12;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=12;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0048469;,citation_issn=1932-6203;,citation_volume=7;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=PLoS ONE;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Model of Illusions and Virtual Reality;,citation_abstract=In Virtual Reality (VR) it is possible to induce illusions in which users report and behave as if they have entered into altered situations and identities. The effect can be robust enough for participants to respond “realistically,” meaning behaviors are altered as if subjects had been exposed to the scenarios in reality. The circumstances in which such VR illusions take place were first introduced in the 80’s. Since then, rigorous empirical evidence has explored a wide set of illusory experiences in VR. Here, we compile this research and propose a neuroscientific model explaining the underlying perceptual and cognitive mechanisms that enable illusions in VR.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Being the Victim of Intimate Partner Violence in Virtual Reality: First- Versus Third-Person Perspective;,citation_abstract=Immersive virtual reality is widely used for research and clinical purposes. Here we explored the impact of an immersive virtual scene of intimate partner violence experienced from the victim’s perspective (first person), as opposed to witnessing it as an observer (third person). We are ultimately interested in the potential of this approach to rehabilitate batterers and in understanding the mechanisms underlying this process. For this, non-offender men experienced the scene either from the perspective of the victim’s virtual body (a female avatar), which moved synchronously with the participants’ real movements, or from the perspective of an observer, while we recorded their behavior and physiological responses. We also evaluated through questionnaires, interviews and implicit association tests their subjective impressions and potential pre/post changes in implicit gender bias following the experience. We found that in all participants, regardless of perspective, the magnitude of the physiological reactions to virtual threatening stimuli was related to how vulnerable they felt for being a woman, the sensation that they could be assaulted, how useful the scene could be for batterer rehabilitation, and how different it would have been to experience the scenario on TV. Furthermore, we found that their level of identification with the female avatar correlated with the decrease in prejudice against women. Although the first-person perspective (1PP) facilitated taking the scene personally, generated a sensation of fear, helplessness, and vulnerability, and tended to induce greater behavioral and physiological reactions, we show that the potential for batterer rehabilitation originates from presence and identification with the victim, which in turn is more easily, but not exclusively, achieved through 1PP.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=New Developments in Virtual Reality-Assisted Treatment of Aggression in Forensic Settings: The Case of VRAPT;,citation_abstract=Aggression is a known problem in individuals being cared for in forensic settings, yet the evidence base for its treatment is scarce. Virtual Reality (VR) has been proposed as a promising addition to interventions in forensic settings, as it may increase the motivation among participants, bridge the gap between real life, therapeutic and laboratory experiences, and increase the ecological validity of psychological research. Recently, a new treatment for aggression using VR as the treatment environment, Virtual Reality Aggression Prevention Training (VRAPT), was developed to provide realistic and safe environments for participants to practice aggression management. In its current revised version, VRAPT is conceptualized as a form of cognitive behavioral therapy with its theoretical background in the General Aggression Model. Its purpose is to increase awareness of, and improve control over, one’s own aggression and that of others through social interactions in individually tailored virtual environments. This manuscript describes how the lessons learned from the first randomized controlled trial of VRAPT have been applied to further develop the method and discusses challenges and future directions for VR-assisted treatment of aggression in forensic settings. VRAPT is a new psychological treatment for aggression and the coming years will provide expanded scientific evidence for further developments and adaptations.;,citation_author=Fernando Renee González Moraga;,citation_author=Stéphanie Klein Tuente;,citation_author=Sean Perrin;,citation_author=Pia Enebrink;,citation_author=Kristina Sygel;,citation_author=Wim Veling;,citation_author=Märta Wallinius;,citation_publication_date=2022-01;,citation_cover_date=2022-01;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.3389/frvir.2021.675004;,citation_issn=2673-4192;,citation_volume=2;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Virtual Reality;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=VR-assisted Aggression Treatment in Forensic Psychiatry: A Qualitative Study in Patients with Severe Mental Disorders;,citation_abstract=Introduction Improvements in virtual reality (VR) have made it possible to create realistic, virtual settings for behavioral assessment and skills training that cannot otherwise be accessed in a safe way in forensic psychiatric settings. VR interventions are under development but little is known how forensic psychiatric patients with severe mental disorders experience VR-assisted assessments or treatments. Methods The present study aimed to help fill this knowledge gap via qualitative interviews with seven patients with severe mental disorders at a high-security forensic psychiatric clinic who had completed the newly revised Virtual Reality Aggression Prevention Training (VRAPT). All participants were interviewed 12 weeks after the VRAPT intervention, and interview data analyzed with manifest inductive content analysis. Results Six manifest content categories were identified: 1. Therapeutic process, 2. VRAPT method, 3. VR technology, 4. Previous treatment experiences, 5. Challenges to treatment of aggression, and 6. Unexpected experiences. The participants had diverse experiences related to both the VRAPT intervention and forensic psychiatric care. Participants described a mixture of positive experiences in relation to VR-assisted role-plays, and less positive in relation to motivation for aggression-focused treatment and technological limitations. Discussion The present findings suggest further studies are needed on how to best implement VR-assisted treatments for aggression in forensic settings, and potentially further modification of treatment content in interventions like VRAPT.;,citation_author=Fernando Renee González Moraga;,citation_author=Pia Enebrink;,citation_author=Sean Perrin;,citation_author=Kristina Sygel;,citation_author=Wim Veling;,citation_author=Märta Wallinius;,citation_publication_date=2024-05;,citation_cover_date=2024-05;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1307633;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assessment of the Emotional Responses Produced by Exposure to Real Food, Virtual Food and Photographs of Food in Patients Affected by Eating Disorders;,citation_abstract=Background: Many researchers and clinicians have proposed using virtual reality (VR) in adjunct to in vivo exposure therapy to provide an innovative form of exposure to patients suffering from different psychological disorders. The rationale behind the ’virtual approach’ is that real and virtual exposures elicit a comparable emotional reaction in subjects, even if, to date, there are no experimental data that directly compare these two conditions. To test whether virtual stimuli are as effective as real stimuli, and more effective than photographs in the anxiety induction process, we tested the emotional reactions to real food (RF), virtual reality (VR) food and photographs (PH) of food in two samples of patients affected, respectively, by anorexia (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) compared to a group of healthy subjects. The two main hypotheses were the following: (a) the virtual exposure elicits emotional responses comparable to those produced by the real exposure; (b) the sense of presence induced by the VR immersion makes the virtual experience more ecological, and consequently more effective than static pictures in producing emotional responses in humans. Methods: In total, 10 AN, 10 BN and 10 healthy control subjects (CTR) were randomly exposed to three experimental conditions: RF, PH, and VR while their psychological (Stait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S) and visual analogue scale for anxiety (VAS-A)) and physiological (heart rate, respiration rate, and skin conductance) responses were recorded. Results: RF and VR induced a comparable emotional reaction in patients higher than the one elicited by the PH condition. We also found a significant effect in the subjects’ degree of presence experienced in the VR condition about their level of perceived anxiety (STAI-S and VAS-A): the higher the sense of presence, the stronger the level of anxiety. Conclusions: Even though preliminary, the present data show that VR is more effective than PH in eliciting emotional responses similar to those expected in real life situations. More generally, the present study suggests the potential of VR in a variety of experimental, training and clinical contexts, being its range of possibilities extremely wide and customizable. In particular, in a psychological perspective based on a cognitive behavioral approach, the use of VR enables the provision of specific contexts to help patients to cope with their diseases thanks to an easily controlled stimulation.;,citation_author=Alessandra Gorini;,citation_author=Eric Griez;,citation_author=Anna Petrova;,citation_author=Giuseppe Riva;,citation_publication_date=2010-12;,citation_cover_date=2010-12;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/1744-859X-9-30;,citation_issn=1744-859X;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Annals of General Psychiatry;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Potential of Virtual Reality as Anxiety Management Tool: A Randomized Controlled Study in a Sample of Patients Affected by Generalized Anxiety Disorder;,citation_abstract=Background: Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a psychiatric disorder characterized by a constant and unspecific anxiety that interferes with daily-life activities. Its high prevalence in general population and the severe limitations it causes, point out the necessity to find new efficient strategies to treat it. Together with the cognitive-behavioural treatments, relaxation represents a useful approach for the treatment of GAD, but it has the limitation that it is hard to be learned. To overcome this limitation we propose the use of virtual reality (VR) to facilitate the relaxation process by visually presenting key relaxing images to the subjects. The visual presentation of a virtual calm scenario can facilitate patients’ practice and mastery of relaxation, making the experience more vivid and real than the one that most subjects can create using their own imagination and memory, and triggering a broad empowerment process within the experience induced by a high sense of presence. According to these premises, the aim of the present study is to investigate the advantages of using a VR-based relaxation protocol in reducing anxiety in patients affected by GAD. Methods/Design: The trial is based on a randomized controlled study, including three groups of 25 patients each (for a total of 75 patients): (1) the VR group, (2) the non-VR group and (3) the waiting list (WL) group. Patients in the VR group will be taught to relax using a VR relaxing environment and audio-visual mobile narratives; patients in the non-VR group will be taught to relax using the same relaxing narratives proposed to the VR group, but without the VR support, and patients in the WL group will not receive any kind of relaxation training. Psychometric and psychophysiological outcomes will serve as quantitative dependent variables, while subjective reports of participants will be used as qualitative dependent variables. Conclusion: We argue that the use of VR for relaxation represents a promising approach in the treatment of GAD since it enhances the quality of the relaxing experience through the elicitation of the sense of presence. This controlled trial will be able to evaluate the effects of the use of VR in relaxation while preserving the benefits of randomization to reduce bias.;,citation_author=Alessandra Gorini;,citation_author=Giuseppe Riva;,citation_publication_date=2008-12;,citation_cover_date=2008-12;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/1745-6215-9-25;,citation_issn=1745-6215;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Trials;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Systematic Review on the Effectiveness of Interventions for Individuals Who Have Committed Online Sexual Crimes Involving Children;,citation_abstract=Objective: Online sexual crimes involving children have increased significantly with greater public access to the internet, underscoring the pressing need for effective intervention programs. While previous reviews attest to the effectiveness of psychological interventions for people who commit sexual offenses, none have specifically addressed those who commit sex crimes involving children using the internet. This systematic review aims to evaluate the effectiveness of psychological intervention programs targeting these crimes, identifying the most effective approaches in behavioral change. Method: The research was conducted across five databases (Scopus, B-on, APA PsycNet, PubMed, and Sage Journals), including studies evaluating the effectiveness of any psychological intervention in adults who have committed sexual crimes involving children through the internet, resulting in nine relevant studies. Most studies employed pre-post designs assessing psychological factors linked to reoffending, emphasizing integrated approaches including cognitive-behavioral therapy, life satisfaction promotion, multimodal treatments, and monitoring. Results: Findings indicated that, in most cases, there were psychological improvements related to criminal behavior, along with a reduction in the frequency and severity of offenses. Methodological limitations were common, such as reliance on pre-post designs, self-reported data, and absence of control groups or conditions. Conclusions:This review underscores the necessity for further research to gauge intervention program effectiveness in this population, stressing larger sample sizes, control group inclusion, and follow-up periods. Despite limitations, the review offers practical insights for clinicians, identifying key treatment components and risk assessment tools useful for personalized intervention planning and clinical decision-making in this population.;,citation_author=Cláudia Gouveia;,citation_author=Teresa Silva;,citation_author=Olga Cunha;,citation_author=Michael C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Longitudinal Outcome Evaluation of a Prison-Based Sex Offender Treatment Program;,citation_abstract=Sex offender outcome studies continue to produce mixed results. A common critique of these studies is their lack of methodological rigor. This study attempts to address this critique by adhering to the standards established by the Collaborative Outcome Data Committee (CODC) aimed at increasing the quality and confidence in outcome studies. We examined recidivism outcomes for a sample of formerly incarcerated sex offenders who participated in a state prison-based cognitive-behavioral-skillsbased treatment program. We used propensity score analysis to compare treatment participants with a matched sample of non-participants. The final sample post-matching (n = 512) was observed for a minimum of 4 years and a maximum of 14 years. Using survival analysis, findings indicate that there were no differences in recidivism rates between treatment participants and non-participants in sexual or violent crimes. However, participants demonstrated significantly lower rates of recidivism for nonviolent crimes. We discuss strengths, limitations of the study, and implications of these findings.;,citation_author=Melissa D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Darwinian Aesthetics: Sexual Selection and the Biology of Beauty;,citation_abstract=Current theoretical and empirical findings suggest that mate preferences are mainly cued on visual, vocal and chemical cues that reveal health including developmental health. Beautiful and irresistible features have evolved numerous times in plants and animals due to sexual selection, and such preferences and beauty standards provide evidence for the claim that human beauty and obsession with bodily beauty are mirrored in analogous traits and tendencies throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. Human beauty standards reflect our evolutionary distant and recent past and emphasize the role of health assessment in mate choice as reflected by analyses of the attractiveness of visual characters of the face and the body, but also of vocal and olfactory signals. Although beauty standards may vary between cultures and between times, we show in this review that the underlying selection pressures, which shaped the standards, are the same. Moreover we show that it is not the content of the standards that show evidence of convergence – it is the rules or how we construct beauty ideals that have universalities across cultures.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Non-Verbal Behavior as Courtship Signals: The Role of Control and Choice in Selecting Partners;,citation_abstract=In this work, we provide evidence based on direct observation of behavior in encounters of opposite-sexed strangers, that women initiate and “control” the outcome. In the first minute of these videotaped 10-min interactions, neither female “solicitation” behavior nor “negative” behavior is strongly related to professed interest in the man, while female “affirmative” behavior at this stage modulates male verbal output in later stages (4 10 min). Although the rate of female courtship-like behavior is significantly higher in the first minute, it is only in the fourth to tenth minute that the rate of female courtship-like behavior is correlated with professed female interest. We hypothesize that this serves as a strategic dynamic reflecting sexual asymmetry in parental investment and the potential cost of male deception to women. Ambiguous protean behavioral strategies veil individuals’ intentions and make their future actions unpredictable. These behavioral strategies may result in men’s overestimation of female sexual interest. D 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Visual Reaction Time™ as a Predictor of Sexual Offense Recidivism;,citation_abstract=In this study, we investigated the use of Visual Reaction Time™ (VRT™) for sexual interest in children to predict recidivism of sexual offenses among men who sexually abused children and men with other sexually deviant behaviors. The authors hypothesized that study participants with a higher VRT™ to stimuli of children would be more likely to sexually reoffend compared with those with a lower VRT™ to stimuli of children. Participants included 621 adult males on parole or probation for acting on a range of sexual paraphilias who sought outpatient treatment or evaluation at two separate therapists’ practices. Sample 1 consisted of 284 adult males followed up (by the lead author) during a 15-year period, while Sample 2 consisted of 337 adult males followed up (by the second author) during a 7-year period. A discrete-time hazard model found VRT™ to children to be significantly related to sexual recidivism. The researchers found that VRT™ to children measured at intake held up in its predictive ability over a 15-year period. When the participants were divided into three groups based on their VRT™, of the 97 participants who measured at least one standard deviation lower than the mean VRT™, 0% reoffended.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Virtual Shopping: A Viable Alternative to Direct Assessment of Real Life Function?;,citation_abstract=Objective: Real-life function is markedly impaired in schizophrenia and is an important outcome for interventions, but direct assessment is time consuming and resource intensive. Virtual reality (VR) enables assessment using simulation, akin to real life (RL), but allowing greater experimental control, reliability, and a more timely assessment. This study explores whether VR simulation predicts RL performance in supermarket shopping and how both relate to underlying cognitive abilities. Method: Forty three people with DSM-IV schizophrenia were included in the study. Participants were required to shop for items using a self-directed search in both RL and VR. In each task, accuracy (number of correct items) and efficiency (time taken and number of aisles entered) were measured. IQ, executive function, working memory, spatial memory and social cognition were also assessed. Results: Specific correlations were found between RL accuracy and VR accuracy, and between RL and VR efficiency measures. Multiple regression analyses indicated that VR efficiency measures contributed significant unique variance to RL efficiency outcomes, in addition to that explained by background cognitive measures, with a final model predicting 58% of variance in RL efficiency. Conclusions: VR functional shopping measures may enhance predictions of real life performance, over and above existing cognitive test procedures, and provide a more time-efficient method for evaluating real life outcomes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychological Treatment of Sexual Offenders Against Children: A Meta-Analytic Review of Treatment Outcome Studies;,citation_abstract=Numerous meta-analyses and reviews have been conducted on the effectiveness of psychological treatment of sexual offenders in reducing recidivism, but no meta-analysis has been done on sexual offenders against children (SOAC) specifically. A moderate treatment effect has been shown in several evaluations of general sexual offenders, while many scholars maintain that the question remains unanswered until an adequate number of effectiveness studies with a strong research design have been carried out. In this meta-analysis, we evaluated 14 studies selected and coded according to Collaborative Outcome Data Committee (CODC) criteria. They included 1,421 adult offenders in psychotherapy and 1,509 nontreated controls, with a minimum average follow-up period of 3 years, published in peer-reviewed journals in 1980 or later. Recidivism was defined as rearrest or reconviction. Study quality was classified into strong, good, weak or rejected. The analysis revealed a treatment effect size of r $\frac{1}{4}$ .03 for nine studies evaluated as Good or Weak, while all studies yielded an effect size of r $\frac{1}{4}$ .08, including five studies classified as Rejected. The results show that the available research cannot establish any effect of treatment on SOAC.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Immediate Processing of Erotic Stimuli in Paedophilia and Controls: A Case Control Study;,citation_abstract=Background Most neuroimaging studies investigating sexual arousal in paedophilia used erotic pictures together with a blocked fMRI design and long stimulus presentation time. While this approach allows the detection of sexual arousal, it does not enable the assessment of the immediate processing of erotically salient stimuli. Our study aimed to identify neuronal networks related to the immediate processing of erotic stimuli in heterosexual male paedophiles and healthy age-matched controls. Methods We presented erotic pictures of prepubescent children and adults in an event related fMRIdesign to eight paedophilic subjects and age-matched controls. Results Erotic pictures of females elicited more activation in the right temporal lobe, the right parietal lobe and both occipital lobes and erotic pictures of children activated the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both groups. An interaction of sex, age and group was present in the right anteriolateral oribitofrontal cortex. Conclusions Our event related study design confirmed that erotic pictures activate some of the brain regions already known to be involved in the processing of erotic pictures when these are presented in blocks. In addition, it revealed that erotic pictures of prepubescent children activate brain regions critical for choosing response strategies in both groups, and that erotically salient stimuli selectively activate a brain region in paedophilic subjects that had previously been attributed to reward and punishment, and that had been shown to be implicated in the suppression of erotic response and deception.;,citation_author=Benedikt Habermeyer;,citation_author=Fabrizio Esposito;,citation_author=Nadja Händel;,citation_author=Patrick Lemoine;,citation_author=Markus Klarhöfer;,citation_author=Ralph Mager;,citation_author=Volker Dittmann;,citation_author=Erich Seifritz;,citation_author=Marc Graf;,citation_publication_date=2013-12;,citation_cover_date=2013-12;,citation_year=2013;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/1471-244X-13-88;,citation_issn=1471-244X;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=BMC Psychiatry;">

Existing physiological and selfreport methods have several limitations. In the present study, sexual interest was assessed indirectly by means of a computer task: the Choice Reaction Time (CRT) task in 49 extrafamilial PSOCs and 25 persons without a history of sexual offences against children (control group). The results showed that PSOCs, the participants with a DSM-IV diagnosis of pedophilia or with a high score on pedophilic interest (measured by the SSPI-2) performed equally fast in the different age category stimuli. In other words, no effect of sexual orientation towards children was found. The control group however, showed longer reaction times for the adult and adolescent stimuli compared to the child stimuli, indicative that they did not have a sexual orientation towards children. The present study found only partial evidence for the validity of the CRT paradigm, as it was effective in discriminating age orientation in the control group but not in the group of PSOCs.;,citation_author=Petra Habets;,citation_author=Inge Jeandarme;,citation_author=Luk Gijs;,citation_author=Beate Dombert;,citation_author=Andreas Mokros;,citation_author=FIF group (collaborators: S.

We next calculated both the readiness potential (RP) and lateralised readiness potential (LRP) for trials with early and late times of awareness. The RP tended to occur later on trials with early awareness of movement initiation than on trials with late awareness, ruling out the RP as a cause of our awareness of movement intiation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Randomized Controlled Study of Group-Administered Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Hypersexual Disorder in Men;,citation_abstract=Background: Hypersexual disorder (HD) is defined as a condition in which the individual loses control over engagement in sexual behaviors, leading to distress and negative effects on key life areas. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been proven to reduce symptoms of hypersexual behavior; however, no randomized controlled study of CBT interventions for HD has been reported previously. Aim: To investigate the efficacy of group-administered CBT for HD. Methods: Male participants (n $\frac{1}{4}$ 137) diagnosed with HD, were randomized between 7 weeks of groupadministered CBT (n $\frac{1}{4}$ 70) and a waitlist control receiving the intervention after 8 weeks (n $\frac{1}{4}$ 67). Measurements were administered at pre-, mid-, and posttreatment, with follow-up after 3 and 6 months. Outcomes: The primary outcome was the Hypersexual Disorder: Current Assessment Scale (HD:CAS), and secondary outcomes were the Sexual Compulsivity Scale (SCS) and measures of depression (Montgomerye Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-S), psychological distress (Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation Outcome Measure (CORE-OM), and treatment satisfaction (CSQ-8). Results: A significantly greater decrease in HD symptoms and sexual compulsivity, as well as significantly greater improvements in psychiatric well-being, were found for the treatment condition compared with the waitlist. These effects remained stable at 3 and 6 months after treatment. Clinical Implications: CBT can ameliorate HD symptoms and psychiatric distress, suggesting that the CBT program may serve as a first-line treatment in clinical settings. Strengths &amp;amp;amp; Limitations: This is the first randomized controlled study evaluating the efficacy of a CBT program in a rather large sample of HD-specific diagnosed men. The long-term treatment effects are vague due to the low response rate on follow-up measurements, and the efficacy of this program for hypersexual women remains unknown. Conclusion: This study supports the efficacy of a group-administered CBT program as a treatment option for HD; however, future studies should include women, comprise dismantling analysis of the constituting interventions, and evaluate other treatment formats, for example, administration via the Internet.

Based on a meta-analysis of 23 recidivism outcome studies meeting basic criteria for study quality, the unweighted sexual and general recidivism rates for the treated sexual offenders were lower than the rates observed for the comparison groups (10.9%, n = 3,121 vs. 19.2%, n = 3,625 for sexual recidivism; 31.8%, n = 1,979 vs. 48.3%, n = 2,822 for any recidivism).

Using a standardized online questionnaire, the heads of 35 prisons and 32 forensic psychiatric hospitals across 14 German federal states were surveyed, reflecting the situation of 16,902 inmates and patients. The findings reveal an absence of shared guidelines as well as an institution-specific approach to sexual behavior and sexual health. Exploratory multiple linear regression identified four variables that predict differences in the regulation of individual’s sexual behavior and sexual health: type of institution (prison or forensic hospital), percentage of institutionalized sex offenders, number of housed individuals, and an item concerning the sexuality-related attitudes of the respondent. Respondents, particularly in the field of forensic psychiatry, expressed a general desire for guidelines. Our study shows that possibilities for sexual expression and sexual health vary strongly, depending on the institution.

METHODS: Applying non-probability sampling and snowball sampling methods, 495 valid questionnaires were collected. The study utilized the Avatar Attractiveness Scale, the short form Player-Avatar Identification Scale (PAI), the Objectified Body Consciousness Scale, and the Avatar Customization Scale. RESULTS: (1) Avatar attractiveness positively predicted self-objectification. (2) Avatar identification mediates the relationship between avatar attractiveness and self- objectification. (3) In the male group, both avatar customization and gender swapping significantly moderated the relationship between avatar attractiveness and avatar identification. (4) In the female group, avatar customization significantly moderated the relationships between avatar attractiveness and self-objectification, as well as between avatar identification and self-objectification. CONCLUSION: Avatar attractiveness can induce young MOBA players’ self-objectification directly as well as through the mediating effect of avatar identification. Avatar customization and gender swapping play moderating roles in this relationship for both male and female groups. This study sheds light on the underlying the impact mechanism of avatar attractiveness on self-objectification, with the aim to identify young MOBA players at a higher risk of self-objectification and propose effective prevention and intervention strategies.;,citation_author=Lujie Hao;,citation_author=Yawen Su;,citation_author=Qingquan Jiang;,citation_publication_date=2025-10;,citation_cover_date=2025-10;,citation_year=2025;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s40359-025-03454-w;,citation_issn=2050-7283;,citation_pmid=41088483;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=BMC psychology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=First, Do No Harm: Critically Revisiting Contemporary Approaches to Child Sexual Abuse Prevention;,citation_abstract=Crime prevention is typically presented in a tripartite model that includes primary, secondary, and tertiary domains. Almost every criminal justice intervention constitutes tertiary prevention and occurs reactively, in the aftermath of an offence. Child sexual abuse is no exception, and prevention science has long recommended we focus our intervention efforts further upstream. Such an approach would include earlier detection and disclosure (secondary prevention), or— even better—reducing the risks of early exposure to the environmental forces which facilitate sexual abuse in the first place (primary prevention). What is missing from the field, however, is a coherent framework through which to critique the unintended consequences of our wellintentioned responses to child sexual abuse. Such consequences include secondary trauma for victim survivors and vicarious trauma for families and practitioners. In this article, we reflect on prevention from a critical perspective that centres the principle of “first, do no harm.” In doing so, we introduce the notion of “quaternary prevention” for child sexual abuse. Public health has long recognised the risks of medicalisation, overdiagnosis, and unnecessary intervention. We encourage our field to engage within a framework of quaternary prevention to consider the iat rogenic effects of many contemporary practices and to take seriously the “do no harm” principle to improve practice across all levels of prevention.;,citation_author=Danielle Arlanda Harris;,citation_author=Michael Sheath;,citation_author=Ryan Shields;,citation_publication_date=2024-07;,citation_cover_date=2024-07;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2024.106859;,citation_issn=01452134;,citation_volume=153;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Child Abuse &amp;amp;amp; Neglect;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex Offender Recidivism: A Simple Question;,citation_abstract=This study examines sexual recidivism, as expressed by new charges or convictions for sexual offences, using the data from 10 follow-up studies of adult male sexual offenders (combined sample of 4,724). Results indicated that most sexual offenders do not re-offend sexually, that first-time sexual offenders are significantly less likely to sexually re-offend than those with previous sexual convictions, and that offenders over the age of 50 are less likely to re-offend than younger offenders. In addition, it was found that the longer offenders remained offence-free in the community the less likely they are to re-offend sexually. Data shows that rapists, incest offenders, “girl-victim” child molesters, and “boy-victim” child molesters recidivate at significantly different rates. These results challenge some commonly held beliefs about sexual recidivism and have implications for policies designed to manage the risk posed by convicted sexual offenders.;,citation_author=Andrew J R Harris;,citation_author=R Karl Hanson;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Das überarbeitete Konzept der Persönlichkeitsstörungen nach ICD-11: Neuerungen und mögliche Konsequenzen für die forensisch-psychiatrische Tätigkeit;,citation_abstract=The introduction of the ICD-11 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 11th ed.) fundamentally changes the diagnostics of personality disorders. The following problems have resulted in the need to depart from the traditional typological notion of personality disorders: the categorical concept of personality disorders as defined by the ICD-10 (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10th ed.) favors the stigmatization of those affected. This has contributed to an underuse of the diagnosis in clinical practice. In turn, when the diagnosis is assigned the prevalence of the personality disorder “not specified” is (too) high or there are high comorbidities between different personality disorders. This casts doubt on the reliability of personality disorders. In addition, follow-up treatment studies with promising results have challenged the justification of the time stability as required by the ICD-10. This article outlines the background for the revision of the conception of personality disorders in order to illustrate the current diagnostic procedure according to the ICD-11. The new conceptions on therapy planning and prognosis are then presented and the implications for forensic psychiatric assessment of criminal liability are discussed.;,citation_author=Nicole C Hauser;,citation_author=Sabine C Herpertz;,citation_author=Elmar Habermeyer;,citation_language=de-DE;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Bioethical Issues and Secondary Prevention for Nonoffending Individuals with Pedophilia;,citation_abstract=Child sexual abuse is a global problem with significant emotional, psychological, and financial implications to victims, perpetrators, and society. Most child sexual abuse prevention programs target young children or those who have already engaged in abusive behavior, in order to prevent further offending. There are numerous secondary prevention programs targeting individuals at-risk of various health conditions in an effort to reduce the likelihood they will go on to experience a particular illness or disease. Considerable research exists regarding the risk factors for engaging in child sexual abuse and more specifically the factors contributing to reoffense. We argue that engaging in secondary prevention programs for people with pedophilia, in order to prevent child sexual abuse, is an ethically responsible and necessary practice. Secondary prevention programs with this focus are reviewed, along with the implications of mandatory reporting in doing this work.;,citation_author=Ainslie Heasman;,citation_author=Thomas Foreman;,citation_publication_date=2019-04;,citation_cover_date=2019-04;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=02;,citation_doi=10.1017/S0963180119000094;,citation_issn=0963-1801, 1469-2147;,citation_volume=28;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics;">

We used a modification of this task, the Single Category–Implicit Association Test (SC-IAT) to unravel child-sex associations in CSOs. Using the SC-IAT, we were able to test whether CSOs indeed hold stronger child-sex associations relative to adult-sex associations, compared to adult sex offenders and nonoffenders. Furthermore, we examined whether contact CSOs differed from noncontact CSOs in their child-sex associations. The hypothesis that CSOs would have stronger child-sex associations, relative to their adult-sex associations, than adult sex offenders and nonoffenders was confirmed. No difference between contact CSOs and noncontact CSOs was found. Although the Sex SC-IAT was able to distinguish CSOs from nonoffenders, the sensitivity and specificity of the test was poor (AUC of .65) and needs refinement. The results of this study support the existence of a child-sex association as a distinctive characteristic of CSOs.

Methods: Twenty healthy female participants were tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design involving sublingual administration of a single dose of testosterone. Four hours after intake, we assessed effects on baseline startle and fear-potentiated startle in a verbal threat-of-shock paradigm. Results: In accordance with predictions, testosterone administration resulted in reduced fear-potentiated startle, without affecting baseline startle.

The present study tested the causality of this relationship by manipulating testosterone levels in a double-blind placebo controlled crossover design. 20 healthy female participants received either a sublingual administration of a single dose of testosterone or placebo on 2 days and were tested 4 h after administration. Because research has shown that facial expression mimicry is a non-obtrusive index of empathy, facial electromyography was measured in response to dynamic facial expressions of happy and angry faces. Results showed that testosterone generally decreased facial mimicry. These findings are consistent with models that assign a critical role to mimicry in the ability to develop and communicate empathy towards conspecifics, and provide a potential causal mechanism of effects of testosterone on empathy.;,citation_author=Erno Jan Hermans;,citation_author=Peter Putman;,citation_author=Jack Honk;,citation_publication_date=2006-08;,citation_cover_date=2006-08;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2006.04.002;,citation_issn=03064530;,citation_volume=31;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychoneuroendocrinology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using an Oculomotor Signature as an Indicator of Aesthetic Preference;,citation_abstract=Eye movements are strongly influenced by the task given to an observer. The immediacy of such eye movements, which are difficult to control consciously, offers the potential to explore highly variable subjective evaluations, such as aesthetic preference, with reliable objective measures. We presented a variety of images in sets of 2, 4, or 8 items for different durations and analyzed oculomotor statistics such as cumulative fixation duration, refixations, and the sequence of fixations while participants searched for their preferred image, after which participants indicated their preference using a button press. The total amount of time spent looking at any image correlates with selection preference and does so increasingly well with longer presentation duration. For short presentations, the first and last fixations correlate better with image preference. All response measures become increasingly variable as the number and complexity of presented images are increased. A weighted combination of these measures can significantly improve the correlation with preference, suggesting a “signature” which could be used as a reliable indicator for task-free subjective evaluation of stimuli in visual psychophysics. Its role as an improved fitness function in visually driven evolutionary algorithms is discussed.;,citation_author=Tim Holmes;,citation_author=Johannes M.

Rev. 2017; 13: 1–75], which synthesized evidence on sexual recidivism as an indicator of treatment effectiveness in persons with sexual offense histories. The updated meta-analysis includes 37 samples comprising a total of 30,394 individuals with sexual offense histories, which is nearly three times the sample size reported by Schmucker and Lösel (2017: 28 samples, N = 9781). In line with Schmucker and Lösel (2017), the mean treatment effect was small with an odds ratio of 1.54 [95% CI 1.22, 1.95] ( p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .001). A moderator analysis suggested three predictors of importance, i.e., risk level, treatment specialization, and author confounding. Greater treatment effectiveness was suggested in high- and medium-compared to low-risk individuals and in specialized compared to non-specialized treatments. Authors affiliated with treatment programs reported larger effectiveness than independent authors. These findings were overall in line with Schmucker and Lösel (2017), though the effects of risk level and treatment specialization were stronger in the current meta-analysis. The findings of the updated meta-analysis reinforce the evidence for the first and second principle of the Risk-Need-Responsivity model. The results may support researchers and decision-makers in interpreting the current evidence on sexual recidivism as an indicator of treatment effectiveness, and, based on that, implement and carry out informative, methodologically sound evaluations of ongoing treatment programs in persons with sexual offense histories.;,citation_author=Lisa Holper;,citation_author=Andreas Mokros;,citation_author=Elmar Habermeyer;,citation_publication_date=2024-04;,citation_cover_date=2024-04;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1177/10790632231159071;,citation_issn=1079-0632, 1573-286X;,citation_volume=36;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sexual Abuse;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Face to Face: Visual Scanpath Evidence for Abnormal Processing of Facial Expressions in Social Phobia;,citation_abstract=Cognitive models of social phobia propose that cognitive biases and fears regarding negative evaluation by others result in preferential attention to interpersonal sources of threat. These fears may account for the hypervigilance and avoidance of eye contact commonly reported by clinicians. This study provides the first objective examination of threat-related processing in social phobia. It was predicted that hyperscanning (hypervigilance) and eye avoidance would be most apparent in social phobia for overt expressions of threat. An infrared corneal reflection technique was used to record visual scanpaths in response to angry, sad, and happy vs. neutral facial expressions. Twenty-two subjects with social phobia were compared with age- and sex-matched normal controls. As predicted, social phobia subjects displayed hyperscanning, (increased scanpath length) and avoidance (reduced foveal fixations) of the eyes, particularly evident for angry faces. The results could not be explained by either medication or co-morbid depression. These findings are consistent with theories emphasising the role of information processing biases in social phobia, and show promise in the application to treatment evaluation in this disorder.;,citation_author=Kaye Horley;,citation_author=Leanne M Williams;,citation_author=Craig Gonsalvez;,citation_author=Evian Gordon;,citation_publication_date=2004-06;,citation_cover_date=2004-06;,citation_year=2004;,citation_issue=1-2;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2004.02.016;,citation_issn=01651781;,citation_volume=127;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Psychiatry Research;">

We compared their experiences across various characteristics. Our findings suggest that those affected by csa by female co-perpetrators report abuse that had an earlier onset, was more severe, and lasted longer than the experiences reported by those affected by csa by female solo perpetrators. the reports further indicate that csa by female co-perpetrators is more likely to be committed by unknown perpetrators and occurs more frequently in religious institutions than csa by female solo perpetrators. these findings highlight a need to raise awareness about different forms of female-perpetrated csa.;,citation_author=Greta Hübener;,citation_author=Johanna Schröder;,citation_author=Peer Briken;,citation_author=Safiye Tozdan;,citation_publication_date=2025-02;,citation_cover_date=2025-02;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1080/0092623X.2025.2462048;,citation_issn=0092-623X, 1521-0715;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Sex &amp;amp;amp; Marital Therapy;">

However, relapse prevention suffers from some conceptual problems, and therefore we have developed a descriptive model that attempts to provide a more satisfactory account of the offense process. This model contains a number of distinct points of individual differences, which create the possibility of different pathways. The current study examines these pathways, evident in offense transcripts from 86 sexual offenders. The majority of offense profiles were classifiable as belonging to three major pathways. Approximately one third reflected an appetitive, positive affect pathway. One quarter of the sample reflected the traditional covert planning, negative affect, restraint pathway.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Role of Human Body Movements in Mate Selection;,citation_abstract=It is common scientific knowledge, that most of what we say within a conversation is not only expressed by the words’ meaning alone, but also through our gestures, postures, and body movements. This non-verbal mode is possibly rooted firmly in our human evolutionary heritage, and as such, some scientists argue that it serves as a fundamental assessment and expression tool for our inner qualities. Studies of nonverbal communication have established that a universal, culture-free, non-verbal sign system exists, that is available to all individuals for negotiating social encounters. Thus, it is not only the kind of gestures and expressions humans use in social communication, but also the way these movements are performed, as this seems to convey key information about an individual’s quality. Dance, for example, is a special form of movement, which can be observed in human courtship displays. Recent research suggests that people are sensitive to the variation in dance movements, and that dance performance provides information about an individual’s mate quality in terms of health and strength. This article reviews the role of body movement in human non-verbal communication, and highlights its significance in human mate preferences in order to promote future work in this research area within the evolutionary psychology framework.;,citation_author=Nadine Hugill;,citation_author=Bernhard Fink;,citation_author=Nick Neave;,citation_publication_date=2010-01;,citation_cover_date=2010-01;,citation_year=2010;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1177/147470491000800107;,citation_issn=1474-7049, 1474-7049;,citation_volume=8;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Evolutionary Psychology;">

We conclude that the task yields reliable and sensitive measures of the processes involved in resolving the conflict between volitional and reflexive behavioral responses, a key cognitive deficit relevant to a number of neuropsychiatric conditions. Additionally, antisaccade deficits may reflect genetic liability for schizophrenia. Finally, the ease and accuracy with which the task can be administered, combined with its sensitivity to fronto-striatal dysfunction and the availability of suitable control conditions, may make it a useful benchmark tool for studies of potential cognitive enhancers.;,citation_author=Samuel B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Vulnerability to Incest – Findings from a Comparative Single-Case Study of the Onset of Intrafamilial Child Sexual Abuse;,citation_abstract=Previous research about intrafamilial child sexual abuse was not able to identify specific risk factors that distinguish this unique subgroup from other sexual offending subgroups. In comparison to other groups of sexual offenders, men convicted of intrafamilial sexual child abuse (ICSA) are found to exhibit more similarities to non-offending fathers than extrafamilial sexual offenders. Consequently, the risk assessment of sexual recidivism among “incest offenders” lacks evidence-based evaluation criteria. Given the suggestion that family system factors should be included in research on the onset of ICSA, we employed the Vulnerability to Incest Model proposed by Trepper and Barrett (1989, https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203776605) in a qualitative single-case analysis. A comparative analysis of ten court evaluations of ICSA offenders revealed that all families in which ICSA has occurred demonstrated at least two vulnerability factors. The analyzed offenders exhibited comparable patterns of masculine sexual entitlement.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Stereoscopic Presentation, Image Motion, and Screen Size on Subjective and Objective Corroborative Measures of Presence;,citation_abstract=Recently, we reported that group subjective measures of presence as well as observers’ postural responses are sensitive to increasing the realism of a display with motion content, by the addition of stereoscopic information, using a 20-inch stereoscopic screen with an effective horizontal field of view of 28 deg. (Freeman, Avons, Meddis, Pearson, &amp;amp;amp; IJsselsteijn, 2000). The experiment presented here employed a large projection display with a 50 deg. horizontal field of view showing a rally car traversing a curved track at speed. The independent variables included image motion and stereoscopic presentation as within-subjects factors and screen size as a between-subjects factor. Dependent variables included subjective measures of presence, vection, involvement, and sickness, as well as observers’ lateral postural responses, which served as a candidate objective corroborative measure of presence. Results demonstrated a noisy yet positive effect of stereoscopic presentation on the lateral postural responses. Post-test subjective ratings revealed a significant effect of stereoscopic presentation on the subjective judgments of presence, but not on those of vection, involvement, or sickness. Image motion had a large and significant effect on the subjective judgments of presence, vection, and involvement. The effect of image motion was considerably larger than that of stereoscopic viewing. By comparing results between experiments, a large effect of screen size on subjective presence ratings could be demonstrated, but only for the video stimulus that contained motion. The postural response measure did not differentiate between screen sizes, thus limiting its utility as an objective corroborative measure of presence, although further research is required to be able to be more firm in our conclusion regarding this issue.;,citation_author=Wijnand IJsselsteijn;,citation_author=Huib Ridder;,citation_author=Jonathan Freeman;,citation_author=S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Presence: Concept, Determinants, and Measurement;,citation_abstract=The concept of presence, i.e. the sensation of “being there” in a mediated environment, has received substantial attention from the virtual reality community, and is becoming increasingly relevant both to broadcasters and display developers. Although research into presence is still at an early stage of development, there is a consensus that presence has multiple determinants. To identify and test which parameters affect presence, a reliable, robust and valid means of measuring presence is required. In this paper, we describe the categories of factors thought to have an impact on presence. Furthermore, we present an overview of various approaches taken to measuring presence, which can be divided into two general categories: subjective measures and objective corroborative measures. Since presence is a subjective experience, the most direct way of assessment is through users’ subjective report. This approach has serious limitations however, and should be used judiciously. Objective measures, such as postural, physiological or social responses to media, can be used to corroborate subjective measures, thereby overcoming some of their limitations. At present, the most promising direction for presence measurement is to develop and use an aggregate measure of presence that is comprised of both subjective and objective components, tailored to the specific medium under study.;,citation_author=Wijnand A.

Despite an increasing use of such response latencies as a diagnostic tool in applied forensic settings, the underlying processes that drive the seemingly robust effect of longer response latencies for sexually attractive targets remain unknown. In the current study, two alternative explanations are presented and tested using an adapted viewing time paradigm that disentangled taskand stimulus-specific processes. Heterosexual and homosexual male participants were instructed to rate the sexual attractiveness of target persons differing in sex and sexual maturation from four experimentally assigned perspectives—heterosexual and homosexual perspectives for both sexes. This vicarious viewing time paradigm facilitated the estimation of the independent contributions of task (assigned perspective) and stimuli to viewing time effects. Results showed a large task-based effect as well as a relatively smaller stimulus-based effect. This pattern suggests that, when viewing time measures are used for the assessment of sexual interest, it should be taken into consideration that response latency patterns can be biased by judging images from a selected perspective.;,citation_author=Roland Imhoff;,citation_author=Alexander F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Viewing Time Effects Revisited: Prolonged Response Latencies for Sexually Attractive Targets Under Restricted Task Conditions;,citation_abstract=Sexually attractive stimuli are watched longer than unattractive stimuli. The processes underlying this robust and reliable viewing time effect are presently not well understood. In the present research comprising four experiments (total N = 250), four classes of potential explanations are proposed and the derived implications were experimentally tested. Contrary to explanations based on either deliberate delay or attentional adhesion to sexually attractive stimuli, prolonged response latencies were also found under restricted task conditions. Sexually preferred targets elicited longer response latencies in a self-paced evaluation task when stimulus pictures were presented for 750 ms (Experiment 1) or for 500 ms and followed by a pattern mask (Experiment 2). Prolonged latencies for sexually preferred targets were also observed when sexual attractiveness was rated in a speeded binary decision task with a response window of 1000 ms (Experiment 3). Eventually, it was shown that the response latency effect in the speeded binary choice task was still preserved when only the heads of target individuals were presented instead of the bodies (Experiment 4).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Motivated Gaze: The View From the Gazer;,citation_abstract=How does gaze relate to psychological properties of the gazer? Studies using eye tracking reveal robust group differences in gaze toward emotional information: Optimists gaze less at negative, unpleasant images than do pessimists, and older individuals look away from negative faces and toward happy faces. These group differences appear to reflect an underlying motivation to achieve and maintain good moods by directing attention to moodfacilitating stimuli. Maintaining a positive mood is only one goal-related context that influences visual attention; recent work has also suggested that other goal states can impact gaze. Gaze therefore is a tool of motivation, directing gazers toward stimuli that are consistent with their goals and away from information that will not facilitate goal achievement.;,citation_author=Derek M.

Participants (N = 106) rated the sexual appeal of sexually provocative pictures while the length of time they spent viewing each picture was unobtrusively measured. As hypothesized, (1) men and women viewed opposite sex pictures significantly longer than same sex pictures, (2) men viewed opposite sex pictures significantly longer than did women, and (3) women viewed same sex pictures significantly longer than did men. Contrary to our prediction, (4) ratings of sexual appeal and viewing time were uncorrelated for either men or women when viewing opposite sex pictures. The results of this study suggest that viewing time is a good measure of categorical sexual interest but a poor measure of withincategory sexual interest for heterosexual men and women.

Risk, Need, and Responsivity (RNR)-based treatment has shown effect on reducing the risk for recidivism in violent crime, but the development of novel treatments is crucial in making the change process more effective. Virtual Reality (VR) technology may be a tool to improve offender treatment. To investigate this, N = 13 offenders with experience from the VR-assisted treatment Virtual Reality Aggression Prevention Training (VRAPT) were interviewed about their experiences using VR in prison, VRAPT, and future treatment needs. Data was analyzed using Inductive Content Analysis. Results showed that VRAPT was seen as helpful through its focus on skills training but needs to be adapted to the challenges of prosocial change in the prison context and to a greater extent address individual needs. Participants’ descriptions varied regarding presence, perceived help from the program, violent antisocial attitudes and change during VRAPT. In the light of these findings, the development of VR-assisted treatment for violent offenders should focus on technical aspects, individual tailoring, and acknowledge the link between reactive and proactive aggression through antisocial attitudes. Such adaptions could make skills training more realistic when using VR and increase VRAPTs feasibility in prison.;,citation_author=David Ivarsson;,citation_author=Pia Enebrink;,citation_author=Carl Delfin;,citation_author=Märta Wallinius;,citation_publication_date=2025-06;,citation_cover_date=2025-06;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1080/15564886.2025.2518581;,citation_issn=1556-4886, 1556-4991;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Victims &amp;amp;amp; Offenders;,citation_publisher=Informa UK Limited;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=EEVEE: The Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment;,citation_abstract=Empathy is a multifaceted emotional and mental faculty that is often found to be affected in a great number of psychopathologies, such as schizophrenia, yet it remains very difficult to measure in an ecological context. The challenge stems partly from the complexity and fluidity of this social process, but also from its covert nature. One powerful tool to enhance experimental control over such dynamic social interactions has been the use of avatars in virtual reality (VR); information about an individual in such an interaction can be collected through the analysis of his or her neurophysiological and behavioral responses. We have developed a unique platform, the Empathy-Enhancing Virtual Evolving Environment (EEVEE), which is built around three main components: (1) different avatars capable of expressing feelings and emotions at various levels based on the Facial Action Coding System (FACS); (2) systems for measuring the physiological responses of the observer (heart and respiration rate, skin conductance, gaze and eye movements, facial expression); and (3) a multimodal interface linking the avatar’s behavior to the observer’s neurophysiological response. In this article, we provide a detailed description of the components of this innovative platform and validation data from the first phases of development. Our data show that healthy adults can discriminate different negative emotions, including pain, expressed by avatars at varying intensities. We also provide evidence that masking part of an avatar’s face (top or bottom half) does not prevent the detection of different levels of pain. This innovative and flexible platform provides a unique tool to study and even modulate empathy in a comprehensive and ecological manner in various populations, notably individuals suffering from neurological or psychiatric disorders.;,citation_author=Philip L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Stigma-Related Stress and Its Correlates Among Men with Pedophilic Sexual Interests;,citation_abstract=Despite decades of research on the adverse consequences of stereotyping and discrimination for many stigmatized groups, little is known about how people with pedophilia perceive and react to stigma. In this article, we present a framework that outlines how stigma-related stress might negatively affect emotional and social areas of functioning, cognitive distortions, and the motivation to pursue therapy, all of which may contribute to an increased risk of sexual offending. We tested our hypotheses in an online survey among self-identified Germanspeaking people with pedophilia (N = 104) using a wide range of validated indicators of social and emotional functioning (Brief Symptom Inventory-53, UCLA Loneliness Scale, Emotion Subscale of the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, Fear of Negative Evaluation-5, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale). Specific risk factors such as self-efficacy, cognitive distortions and the motivation to seek treatment were also assessed. In line with our hypotheses, fear of discovery generally predicted reduced social and emotional functioning. Contrary to our predictions, perceived social distance and fear of discovery were not linked to self-efficacy, cognitive distortions, or treatment motivation. Results were controlled for the effects of confounding variables (e.g, age, educational level, social desirability, relationship status). We critically evaluate the empirical contribution of this study to research on stigma and child sex offenses, including a discussion of the results in light of the potential indirect effects that public stigma may have on the overall risk for sexual offenses.;,citation_author=Sara Jahnke;,citation_author=Alexander F.

The data showed a decreased focus on their own “beautiful” body parts in the high symptomatic participants, whereas inspection of their own “ugly” body parts was given priority. In the normal control group a self-serving cognitive bias was found: they focused more on their own “beautiful” body parts and less on their own “ugly” body parts. When viewing other bodies the pattern was reversed: high symptom participants allocated their attention to the beautiful parts of other bodies, whereas normal controls concentrated on the ugly parts of the other bodies.

The ICD-11 introduces a dimensional approach, replacing the previous categorical system with a focus on severity and maladaptive personality traits. This shift addresses longstanding criticisms of the ICD-10, such as underdiagnosis, diagnostic instability, and lack of scientific validity. The new model classifies personality disorders by severity (mild, moderate, severe) and five trait domains, enhancing clinical nuance but also introducing challenges in continuity and communication. While the ICD-11 aims to improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning, concerns remain regarding overdiagnosis, increased stigma-especially among adolescents and the adequacy of trait coverage. The absence of validated diagnostic tools and clear severity thresholds further complicates forensic application. Preliminary studies suggest a dramatic increase in diagnosed cases under ICD-11, raising questions about the risk of pathologizing normative behavior and the potential for excessive intervention. The paper highlights the need for further research and careful implementation to balance improved recognition of personality pathology with the avoidance of unintended negative consequences in forensic practice.;,citation_author=Camille Jantzi;,citation_author=Valerie Moulin;,citation_publication_date=2025-08;,citation_cover_date=2025-08;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2025.1630512;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;,citation_publisher=Frontiers;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Improving Adherence to Unguided Internet-based Therapy for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial;,citation_abstract=Background: Adherence to internet-based cognitive-behavioral therapy (iCBT) is often low, possibly reducing its potential. The current study set out to test whether adherence and effects of unguided iCBT for obsessivecompulsive disorder (OCD) could be improved by varying the degree of autonomy in which modules are completed (free choice vs. fixed order). Methods: We randomized 151 individuals with OCD to either an unguided iCBT with a fixed (iCBTfixed) or a freechoice (iCBTfree+) order of the modules. We assessed participants at baseline (t0), eight weeks (t1), and 16 weeks (t2). Primary outcomes were adherence (utilization time, modules completed) and change in OCD severity (Y-BOCS). Secondary outcomes included depression, self-esteem, and treatment satisfaction. We calculated intent-to-treat (ITT) and complete case (CC) analyses. Results: Analyses showed that both iCBT programs significantly reduced OCD severity. While groups did not differ on the ITT analyses, for the CC analyses, a greater improvement was found in the iCBTfixed in comparison to the iCBTfree+ group regarding OCD severity and quality of life, with medium effect sizes from t0 to t1 ($\eta$p2 = 0.067–0.077). Time of utilization and number of modules completed did not differ between groups. Limitations: No placebo control group, short follow-up period, self-report assessment. Conclusions: iCBT is effective in improving OCD. Despite similar adherence in the fixed versus the free-choice module order, the study offers tentative evidence that a fixed order of content is associated with better ef fects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Review of the Empirical and Clinical Support for Group Therapy Specific to Sexual Abusers;,citation_abstract=This review compiles 48 empirical studies and 55 clinical/practice articles specific to group therapy with sex offenders. Historically, group therapy has always been the predominant modality in sex offender–specific treatment. In the first decades of the field, treatment applied a psychoanalytic methodology that, although not empirically supported, fully appreciated the primary therapeutic importance of the group modality. Conversely, since the early 1980s, treatment has applied a cognitive behavioral method, but the field has largely neglected the therapeutic value of the interpersonal group dynamics. The past decade has seen a growing re-appreciation of general therapeutic processes and more holistic approaches in sex offender treatment, and there is an emerging body of empirical research which, although often indirectly concerned with group, has yielded three definitive conclusions. First, the therapeutic qualities of the group therapist—specifically warmth, empathy, encouragement, and guidance—can strongly affect outcomes. Second, the quality of group cohesion can profoundly affect the effectiveness of treatment. Third, confrontational approaches in group therapy are ineffective, if not counter-therapeutic, and overwhelmingly rated as not helpful by sex offenders themselves. Additional conclusions are less strongly supported, but include compelling evidence that sex offenders generally prefer group therapy over individual therapy, that group therapy appears equally effective to individual therapy, and that mixing or separating groups by offense type is not important to therapeutic climate. Other group techniques and approaches specific to sexual abuse treatment are also summarized.;,citation_author=Jerry L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Abuse History among Adult Sex Offenders and Non-Sex Offenders: A Meta-Analysis;,citation_abstract=Objective: The sexually abused–sexual abuser hypothesis states there is a specific relationship between sexual abuse history and sexual offending, such that individuals who experience sexual abuse are significantly more likely to later engage in sexual offenses. Therefore, samples of adult sex offenders should contain a disproportionate number of individuals who have experienced sexual abuse, but not necessarily other types of abuse, compared with samples of other types of offenders. Methods: We compared rates of sexual and other forms of abuse reported in 17 studies, involving 1,037 sex offenders and 1,762 non-sex offenders. We also examined the prevalence of different forms of abuse in 15 studies that compared adult sex offenders against adults (n = 962) and against children (n = 1,334), to determine if the sexually abused–sexual abuser association is even more specific to individuals who sexually offend against children. Results: We observed a higher prevalence of sexual abuse history among adult sex offenders than among non-sex offenders (Odds Ratio = 3.36, 95% confidence intervals of 2.23–4.82). The two groups did not significantly differ with regard to physical abuse history (OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.88–2.56). There was a significantly lower prevalence of sexual abuse history among sex offenders against adults compared to sex offenders against children (OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.35–0.74), whereas the opposite was found for physical abuse (OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.02–2.02). Conclusion: There is support for the sexually abused–sexual abuser hypothesis, in that sex offenders are more likely to have been sexually abused than non-sex offenders, but not more likely to have been physically abused.

Fearing who would find out encapsulates the fear that disclosing to one person will spread beyond the initial disclosure. A need for a cue reflects the participants’ lack of knowledge and the need for invitations to talk about sex and abuse. Fearing it was my fault conveys the participants’ sense of guilt and their wish to understand that they were not to blame.

By contrast, here we show that when choosing between composite faces with raised or lowered apparent health, women’s preferences for faces that are perceived as healthy are (i) stronger during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle than during the late follicular, fertile phase, (ii) stronger in pregnant women than in non–pregnant women and (iii) stronger in women using oral contraceptives than in women with natural menstrual cycles. Change in preference for male faces was greater for short– than long–term relationships.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Reporting of Harms in Randomized Controlled Trials of Psychological Interventions for Mental and Behavioral Disorders: A Review of Current Practice;,citation_abstract=Background: Data suggest that certain psychological interventions can induce harm in a significant number of patients. While the need for adequate reporting of harms in clinical trials has repeatedly been emphasized, it is uncertain whether such information is routinely collected and reported in trials within this research field. Method: We used the two major databases in clinical psychology and medicine (PsycINFO and PubMed) to identify original publications from 2010 reporting randomized controlled trials of psychological interventions for patients with mental and behavioral disorders. Two reviewers searched the full-text reports for information about monitoring of adverse events, side effects, and deterioration. Results: A total of 132 eligible trials were identified. Only 28 trials (21%) included information that indicated any monitoring of harms on patient level. Four (3%) of these trials provided a description of adverse events as well as the methods used for collecting these data. Five of the trials (4%) reported adverse events but did not give complete information about the method. An additional four reports (3%) briefly stated that no adverse events occurred, whereas 15 trials (11%) only provided information on deterioration or indicated monitoring of deterioration. The probability of including harm-related information was related to the journal impact factor. Conclusion: Important information about harms is not reported systematically within this research field, suggesting that the risk of reporting bias is nontrivial in conclusions about the risk–benefit ratio of psychological treatments.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Are There Any Biomarkers for Pedophilia and Sexual Child Abuse? A Review;,citation_abstract=The use of biomarkers in medicine is a common and valuable approach in several clinical fields. Understanding the relationship between measurable biological processes and clinical outcomes not only is indispensable in the face of understanding physiological processes in healthy as well as in diseased organisms but also for understanding and evaluating treatment effects. Therefore, also in the context of forensic psychiatry, biomarkers and their potentially beneficial effects are of growing interest. The objective of this review is to examine if there are biomarkers that may serve as a tool to support diagnostic process, treatment evaluation, and risk assessment of pedophilic individuals and child sexual offenders. In the first part, we present an overview of the current neurobiological, as well as physiological and psychophysiological approaches to characterize pedophilia and child sexual offending. Secondly, we discuss and evaluate the impact of these approaches on the development of biomarkers for diagnosis, therapy, and risk assessment in pedophilic subjects and child sexual offenders. We conclude that a lot of research has already enhanced our neurobiological knowledge about pedophilia and child sexual offending. Although there surely exist promising parameters and approaches, in our view currently none of these is ready yet to serve as a clinically applicable diagnostic, response, or predictive biomarker for pedophilia and child sexual offending. Therefore, further work remains to be done. The development of a composite diagnostic biomarker to assess deviant sexual interest, combining several measures like functional magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, eye tracking, and behavioral approaches seems to be most promising. A valid and reliable measurement of deviant sexual interest, insensitive to manipulations could significantly support clinical diagnostic process. Similarly, regarding therapy evaluation and risk assessment, a composite biomarker to assess inhibitory control functions seems to be promising.

However, further research is needed. A lot of indirect measures are still at the developmental stage regarding clinical application. They do not reach appropriate psychometric criteria or are not yet sufficiently tested for susceptibility to manipulation or deception. Furthermore, for some paradigms, the exact mechanisms underlying the attentional processes are still under discussion. This study aimed to measure sexual interest under cognitive load. With this challenging active task subject’s possibility to manipulate their response to the sexual stimuli should be lower than in easier tasks and in passive designs. Twenty-two pedophiles, seven forensic control subjects and 50 healthy men performed cognitive tasks. Simultaneously, sexually relevant and sexually non-relevant distractors were presented.

Meta-analyses and reviews report only moderate and often mutually inconsistent effects. Case presentation: Based on the case of a 47 year old exclusively pedophilic forensic inpatient, we examined the effectiveness of a new eye tracking method and a new functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)-design in regard to the evaluation of ADT in pedophiles. We analyzed the potential of these methods in exploring the impact of ADT on automatic and controlled attentional processes in pedophiles.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Could We Measure Sexual Interest Using Functional Imaging?;,citation_abstract=The assessment of deviant sexual preference has a long tradition in forensic psychiatry, as it is one of the strongest predictors for sexual offence recidivism. From a clinical point of view, an objective assessment of sexual preference, i.e. independent of the patient’s subjective response, is of great importance. Functional brain imaging offers one convenient approach, given the possible advantages of measuring neurofunctional processes, e.g. the possible low susceptibility to manipulations of the brain activation or the non-intrusiveness of the method. Till this day we do not have a clinical tool to assess sexual preference based on brain imaging methods. In contrast, basic functional neuroimaging research serves as a comprehensive source of knowledge about the underlying neural correlates of human sexual arousal in healthy subjects. Our review implies an overview about the most common experimental designs used in functional imaging studies measuring sexual arousal and sexual preference. Based on these studies the most recent knowledge has been summarized, showing the neural underpinnings of sexual arousal and sexual preference in healthy subjects and paraphilic patients. Results show a relatively clear network evoked by sexually arousing stimuli in healthy subjects and paraphilic patients, which can be described in the so-called four-component model of sexual arousal. Studies assessing sexual preference do not deliver such a clear picture. Despite some interesting results of several studies, till this day we do not know which brain regions respond exclusively to a sexually preferred stimulus. These results as well as methodological aspects are critically discussed in order to improve experimental designs. At last, the potential and limitations of the assessment of (deviant) sexual preference using fMRI are disputed.;,citation_author=Kirsten Jordan;,citation_author=Peter Fromberger;,citation_author=Jürgen L Müller;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sexual Offender Treatment;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Impaired Attentional Control in Pedophiles in a Sexual Distractor Task;,citation_abstract=Pedophilic disorder, a subtype of paraphilia, is defined as a recurrent sexual interest in prepubescent children, which is characterized by persistent thoughts, fantasies, urges, sexual arousal, or behavior. Besides a deviant sexual preference, sexual preoccupation was found to be a dynamic risk factor for reoffending. Thus, it is conceivable that sex offenders and especially sex offenders against children have difficulties to control their responses to sexual stimuli. In the current study pedophiles, forensic and non-forensic control subjects had to solve a cognitive task, while sexual distractors were presented simultaneously. This kind of task also requires control functions. Therefore, data were analyzed with respect to attentional control while comparing eye movements toward sexual distractors and toward the cognitive task. We were mainly interested in how early (fixation latency) and late (relative fixation time) attentional processes were allocated to both, the cognitive target stimuli and the sexual distractors. Pedophiles demonstrated significantly lower attentional control in the sexual distractor task than both control groups (non-pedophiles). They showed a shorter fixation latency and longer fixation time for sexual distractors than non-pedophiles. Furthermore, pedophiles demonstrated a longer fixation latency and shorter fixation time for cognitive target stimuli. For classification analyses, an attentional control index (ACI) was built, i.e., the difference between eye movements on cognitive target stimuli and sexual distractors. For the ACI of early attentional processes, i.e., fixation latency, a good classification between pedophiles and non-pedophiles was found. We assumed that the measured attentional control represents inhibitory executive functions, specifically interference control. Further studies should examine if low attentional control in pedophiles is due to low motivation to solve the task or rather to a lack of ability to control attention with respect to sexual and/or neutral distractors. Prospectively, this design could be useful to generate hypotheses about clinical important aspects of controllability, the capacity of self-control, and the severity of a paraphilic disorder.;,citation_author=Kirsten Jordan;,citation_author=Peter Fromberger;,citation_author=Jakob Herder;,citation_author=Henrike Steinkrauss;,citation_author=Rebekka Nemetschek;,citation_author=Joachim Witzel;,citation_author=Jürgen L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Role of Testosterone in Sexuality and Paraphilia—A Neurobiological Approach. Part I: Testosterone and Sexuality;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Antiandrogen therapy has been used for 30 years to treat paraphilic patients and sexual offenders. Yet the therapeutic success of antiandrogens is uncertain. Furthermore, there is still a lack of comprehensive knowledge about the effects of androgen-lowering therapy in paraphilic patients. Aim. This article reviews current neurobiological and clinical knowledge about testosterone and its impact on sexuality, acquired from animal and human basic research. This knowledge may not only enhance our understanding of the great variability of the therapeutic outcome, but could also offer new opportunities to evaluate the effect of androgen-lowering therapy in paraphilia. Methods. A comprehensive review of the human and animal literature is presented, considering the classical and non-classical mechanisms of androgens and the androgen brain receptors. Furthermore, the clinical evidence about the impact of testosterone on human sexual behavior is discussed. These are integrated into two current neurobiological theories of sexual behavior, the four-component model and the dual-control model. Results. The wide distribution of androgen receptors throughout the whole brain and their numerous mechanisms demonstrate that androgens can modulate almost every aspect of sexual behavior—i.e., not only autonomic functions, but also emotional, motivational, and cognitive aspects. Furthermore, testosterone participates in excitatory and inhibitory processes of sexual functions by modulating the activity of mainly dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. Conclusions. Using the data presented, we combine the two models and present a new integrated approach to understand the role of testosterone in the excitation and inhibition of sexual function, at the neurochemical, neuroanatomical, and behavioral levels. This knowledge will help us to gain a better understanding of the few and inconsistent data that are currently available concerning (i) the association between testosterone and paraphilic behavior; and (ii) the highly variable effects of antiandrogen therapy, discussed in Part II of this review.

Part II: Testosterone and Paraphilia;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Antiandrogen therapy has been used for 30 years to treat paraphilic patients and sexual offenders. Yet the therapeutic success of antiandrogens is uncertain. Furthermore, there is still a lack of comprehensive knowledge about the effects of androgen-lowering therapy in paraphilic patients. Aim. We discuss endocrinological, neurobiological, and therapeutic aspects of paraphilia with the aim of integrating these on the basis of the current neurobiological and clinical knowledge on testosterone that was set out in Part I of this review. Methods. Our review of the human literature comprises the current knowledge about the neurobiology of paraphilia and the known endocrinological, pathophysiological, and genetic aspects of this disorder. The role of testosterone is discussed. A survey of antiandrogen therapy and its outcome in paraphilic patients and sex offenders is provided. Results. Although not all data are consistent, current imaging research suggests that structural and functional changes in pedophilia appear for the most part in brain regions also involved in sexual functions. Not exclusively testosterone but also some other endocrinological and neurochemical parameters could be disturbed in pedophilic patients and child molesters; these include changes in hypothalamic–pituitary function, prolactin levels, and dopaminergic or serotonergic functions. There appears to be a sex-steroid-related genetic influence on antisocial traits, externalizing behavior, and sexual behavior. Most of the studies in which antiandrogen therapy in paraphilic patients and sex offenders have been examined were case reports, or observational or open-label studies, and many did not include adequate control groups. Only a few placebo-controlled double-blind studies have been published with inconsistent results concerning treatment effects. Outcome measures differ between the studies and do not seem ideally suited to their purpose. Conclusions. On the basis of the current knowledge about testosterone and its effects on brain and behavior as described in Part I, and of available results on the relationship between testosterone and paraphilia as well as antiandrogen therapy, we present from a neurobiological perspective an extended scientific proposal for design features to investigate the effects of antiandrogen treatment in large clinical trials.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Interest and Sexual Self-Control in Men with Self-Reported Sexual Interest in Children – A First Eye Tracking Study;,citation_abstract=Sexual child abuse is one of the most destructive events for child development. One possible approach to avert it is the preventive treatment of individuals with a sexual interest in children. The aim of the current eye tracking study was to compare people with a self-reported sexual interest in children who participate in the outpatient preventive treatment project “PsM”, pedophilic forensic inpatients, and a non-pedophilic control group. Groups were compared with respect to sexual interest and attentional control in the presence of sexual stimuli, both assessed independently of self-report. Two approaches were applied, namely the initial orientation approach for measuring sexual interest, and a sexual distractor task for measuring attentional control. Our data showed for the first time that outpatients with a self-reported sexual interest in children differed from pedophilic forensic inpatients with respect to attentional control but not with regard to sexual interest. Outpatients showed similar sexual interest in children as pedophilic forensic inpatients. They demonstrated significantly better attentional control than pedophilic forensic inpatients in the face of adult sexual stimuli, but the difference regarding child sexual stimuli did not reach significance. This might reflect a higher capacity for self-control and self-regulation in these patients. Nevertheless, child stimuli remain to be important distractors for them. Our results provide valuable additional information for the diagnosis and therapy of outpatients with a self-reported sexual interest in children. Obviously, these data are preliminary and further studies with larger groups should examine if they are replicable.;,citation_author=Kirsten Jordan;,citation_author=Peter Fromberger;,citation_author=Isabel Müller;,citation_author=Martina Wernicke;,citation_author=Georg Stolpmann;,citation_author=Jürgen L.

Behavioral performance and eye movements were measured. FP-SOC and NFP-SOC exhibit same age preference patterns for children and adults, but both groups differ significantly with respect to sexual attentional control. Moderate discrimination accuracy and moderate effect sizes resulted for sexual interest, and good discrimination accuracy and large effect sizes were found for attentional control. Good attentional control in the NFP-SOC, probably reflecting superior sexual self-control and self-regulation abilities, might contribute to a better recognition and control of environmental factors in sexual risk situations, preventing them from being detected and convicted. Otherwise, strong cognitive distortions might serve for them as offense justification. We conclude that those non-forensic persons with sexual offense histories against children (NFP-SOC) with sexual interest in children, good attentional self-control and strong cognitive distortions represent a problematic group which should receive more attention regarding further research but also therapy. Future studies should include more suitable and larger control groups, appropriate instruments to measure independent variables, and investigate whether different classifications of pedophilic interest would be better suited to describe the eye movement patterns of our study participants.;,citation_author=Kirsten Jordan;,citation_author=Isabel Müller;,citation_author=Peter Fromberger;,citation_author=Uwe Dobrunz;,citation_author=Ute Franz;,citation_author=Jürgen Leo Müller;,citation_publication_date=2024-11;,citation_cover_date=2024-11;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1177/10790632241297271;,citation_issn=1079-0632, 1573-286X;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sexual Abuse;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Women and Men Exhibit Different Cortical Activation Patterns during Mental Rotation Tasks;,citation_abstract=The strongest sex differences on any cognitive task, favoring men, are found for tasks that require the mental rotation of three-dimensional objects. A number of studies have explored functional brain activation during mental rotation tasks, and sex differences have been noted in some. However, in these studies there was a substantial confounding factor because male and female subjects differed in overall performance levels. In contrast, our functional brain activation study examined cortical activation patterns for males and females who did not differ in overall level of performance on three mental rotation tasks. This allowed us to eliminate any confounding influences of overall performance levels. Women exhibited significant bilateral activations in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and the superior and inferior parietal lobule, as well as in the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and the premotor areas. Men showed significant activation in the right parieto-occitpital sulcus (POS), the left intraparietal sulcus and the left superior parietal lobule (SPL). Both men and women showed activation of the premotor areas but men also showed an additional significant activation of the left motor cortex. No significant activation was found in the inferior temporal gyrus. Our results suggest that there are genuine between-sex differences in cerebral activation patterns during mental rotation activities even when performances are similar. Such differences suggest that the sexes use different strategies in solving mental rotation tasks.;,citation_author=K Jordan;,citation_publication_date=2002;,citation_cover_date=2002;,citation_year=2002;,citation_issue=13;,citation_doi=10.1016/S0028-3932(02)00076-3;,citation_issn=00283932;,citation_volume=40;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Neuropsychologia;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Event-Related f MRI;,citation_abstract=We present a method for detecting event-related responses in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The occurrence of time-locked activations is formulated in terms of the general linear model, i.e., multiple linear regression. This permits the use of established statistical techniques that correct for multiple comparisons in the context of spatially smooth and serially correlated data. Responses are modelled using event-related temporal basis functions. Inferences are then made about all components of the model, using the F-ratio at all voxels in the image, to produce a statistical parametric map (SPM5F6). This method allows for the experimental design to relate the timing of events to the acquisition of data to give a temporal resolution (with respect to the event-related response) far better than the scanning repeat time.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Neuropsychology and Neurology of Sexual Deviance: A Review and Pilot Study;,citation_abstract=Current neurological hypotheses of paraphilia posit that sexual deviance is associated with frontal and/or temporal lobe damage. This broad conception is based on few investigations, however, and the first goal of this study was to review the existing data derived from neuropsychiatry, neuroimaging and neuropsychology. It is concluded that although fronto-temporal dysfunctions are sporadically reported among sexual offenders, the evidence is scarce and it might not be specific to this type of offending. The second objective of this investigation was to gather preliminary neuropsychological data with more homogeneous subgroups of sexual offenders. A profile of lower-order executive dysfunctions (e.g. sustained attention and inhibition) and verbal deficits with intact or good capacities for higher-order executive functioning (e.g. reasoning and cognitive flexibility) and visuo-spatial processing was preferentially found among sexual offenders, suggesting basal fronto-temporal anomalies. Importantly, pedophiles were more consistently and severely impaired than rapists of adults. However, this basal fronto-temporal profile is not characteristic of sexual deviance, as it is also found in association with delinquency and criminality in general. Future neuropsychological and brain imaging studies should consider subgroups of sexual offenders and recruit nonsexual violent persons and non-violent individuals in order to disentangle the complex relations between brain anomalies and sexual deviance.;,citation_author=Christian C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Neuropsychology of Sex Offenders: A Meta-Analysis;,citation_abstract=Typically, neuropsychological studies of sex offenders have grouped together different types of individuals and different types of measures. This is why results have tended to be nonspecific and divergent across studies. Against this background, the authors undertook a review of the literature regarding the neuropsychology of sex offenders, taking into account subgroups based on criminological theories. They also conducted a meta-analysis of the data to demonstrate the cognitive heterogeneity of sex offenders statistically. Their main objective was to test the hypothesis to the effect that the neuropsychological deficits of sex offenders are not broad and generalized compared with specific subgroups of participants based on specific measures. In all, 23 neuropsychological studies reporting data on 1,756 participants were taken into consideration. As expected, a highly significant, broad, and heterogeneous overall effect size was found. Taking subgroups of participants and specific cognitive measures into account significantly improved homogeneity. Sex offenders against children tended to obtain lower scores than did sex offenders against adults on higher order executive functions, whereas sex offenders against adults tended to obtain results similar to those of non-sex offenders, with lower scores in verbal fluency and inhibition. However, it is concluded that neuropsychological data on sex offenders are still too scarce to confirm these trends or to test more precise hypotheses. For greater clinical relevance, future neuropsychological studies should consider specific subgroups of participants and measures to verify the presence of different cognitive profiles.;,citation_author=Christian C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparison of the Levels of Presence and Anxiety in an Acrophobic Environment Viewed via HMD or CAVE;,citation_abstract=People who suffer from acrophobia fear any situation that involves heights. Several Virtual Reality systems have been presented to treat this problem. This paper presents a comparison study of the levels of presence and anxiety in an acrophobic environment that is viewed using a Computer Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and a Head-Mounted Display (HMD). In this environment, the floor fell away and the walls rose up. To determine whether either of the two visualization systems induced a greater sense of presence/anxiety in non-phobic users, an experiment comparing the two visualization systems was carried out. Twenty-five participants took part in this study. After using each visualization system (HMD or CAVE), the participants were asked to fill out an adapted Slater et al. questionnaire, and a Student t test was applied to the data obtained. The CAVE induces a high level of presence in users. The mean score was 5.01 (where 7 is the maximum value), which was higher than the score obtained using the HMD which was 3.59. The Student t test indicates that there are significant statistical differences. The level of anxiety was also examined at different times during the experiment. The results indicate that both visualization systems provoke anxiety, but that the CAVE provokes more anxiety than the HMD. The animation in which the floor falls away is the one that provoked the most anxiety. The results from the correlation between the anxiety and the level of presence at the three times indicated a significant correlation between the two measures.;,citation_author=M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Treating Stimuli as a Random Factor in Social Psychology: A New and Comprehensive Solution to a Pervasive but Largely Ignored Problem.;,citation_abstract=Throughout social and cognitive psychology, participants are routinely asked to respond in some way to experimental stimuli that are thought to represent categories of theoretical interest. For instance, in measures of implicit attitudes, participants are primed with pictures of specific African American and White stimulus persons sampled in some way from possible stimuli that might have been used. Yet seldom is the sampling of stimuli taken into account in the analysis of the resulting data, in spite of numerous warnings about the perils of ignoring stimulus variation (Clark, 1973; Kenny, 1985; Wells &amp;amp;amp; Windschitl, 1999). Part of this failure to attend to stimulus variation is due to the demands imposed by traditional analysis of variance procedures for the analysis of data when both participants and stimuli are treated as random factors. In this article, we present a comprehensive solution using mixed models for the analysis of data with crossed random factors (e.g., participants and stimuli). We show the substantial biases inherent in analyses that ignore one or the other of the random factors, and we illustrate the substantial advantages of the mixed models approach with both hypothetical and actual, well-known data sets in social psychology (Bem, 2011; Blair, Chapleau, &amp; Judd, 2005; Correll, Park, Judd, &amp; Wittenbrink, 2002).;,citation_author=Charles M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural Activation Toward Erotic Stimuli in Homosexual and Heterosexual Males;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Studies investigating sexual arousal exist, yet there are diverging findings on the underlying neural mechanisms with regard to sexual orientation. Moreover, sexual arousal effects have often been confounded with general arousal effects. Hence, it is still unclear which structures underlie the sexual arousal response in homosexual and heterosexual men. Aim. Neural activity and subjective responses were investigated in order to disentangle sexual from general arousal. Considering sexual orientation, differential and conjoint neural activations were of interest. Methods. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study focused on the neural networks involved in the processing of sexual stimuli in 21 male participants (11 homosexual, 10 heterosexual). Both groups viewed pictures with erotic content as well as aversive and neutral stimuli. The erotic pictures were subdivided into three categories (most sexually arousing, least sexually arousing, and rest) based on the individual subjective ratings of each participant. Main Outcome Measures. Blood oxygen level-dependent responses measured by fMRI and subjective ratings. Results. A conjunction analysis revealed conjoint neural activation related to sexual arousal in thalamus, hypothalamus, occipital cortex, and nucleus accumbens. Increased insula, amygdala, and anterior cingulate gyrus activation could be linked to general arousal. Group differences emerged neither when viewing the most sexually arousing pictures compared with highly arousing aversive pictures nor compared with neutral pictures. Conclusion. Results suggest that a widespread neural network is activated by highly sexually arousing visual stimuli. A partly distinct network of structures underlies sexual and general arousal effects. The processing of preferred, highly sexually arousing stimuli recruited similar structures in homosexual and heterosexual males.

Background: MR,VR, and AR have already been used as training tools in a variety of domains. However, the question of whether or not these manipulations are effective for training has not been quantitatively and conclusively answered. Evidence shows that, while extended realities can often be time-saving and cost-saving training mechanisms, their efficacy as training tools has been debated. Method: The current body of literature was examined and all qualifying articles pertaining to transfer of training from MR,VR, and AR were included in the meta- analysis. Effect sizes were calculated to determine the effects that XR-based factors, trainee-based factors, and task-based factors had on performance measures after XR-based training. Results: Results showed that training in XR does not express a different outcome than training in a nonsimulated, control environment. It is equally effective at enhancing performance. Conclusion: Across numerous studies in multiple fields, extended realities are as effective of a training mechanism as the commonly accepted methods.

Aim: This expert opinion review article discusses standard operating procedures when using sexual stimuli in clinical and research applications, addressing 3 broad areas: settings in which sexual stimuli are used, characteristics and contexts of the stimuli, and practical and ethical considerations when using the stimuli. Methods: This article is based on an expert opinion review of the sexual psychophysiology literature. Results: First, we discuss the settings in which sexual stimuli are typically used and evaluate the ecological validity of each setting. Second, we review the types of sexual stimuli used in sexual response research, including physical characteristics, depicted sexual activity, and context, and the impacts of these characteristics on sexual response. Last, we discuss the practical and ethical considerations that come with the choice and use of sexual stimuli in clinical and research settings. We address potential limitations of certain sexual stimuli, including practical and ethical considerations such as participant vs experimenter choice, diversity and representation, and proper sourcing of sexual stimuli for use in clinical and research applications. Discussions on the future applications of sexual stimuli, such as the use of virtual reality, and ethical considerations in terms of user-generated Internet sexual stimuli are also explored.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Validation Relaxation: A Quality Assurance Strategy for Electronic Data Collection;,citation_abstract=Background: The use of mobile devices for data collection in developing world settings is becoming increasingly common and may offer advantages in data collection quality and efficiency relative to paper-based methods. However, mobile data collection systems can hamper many standard quality assurance techniques due to the lack of a hardcopy backup of data. Consequently, mobile health data collection platforms have the potential to generate datasets that appear valid, but are susceptible to unidentified database design flaws, areas of miscomprehension by enumerators, and data recording errors. Objective: We describe the design and evaluation of a strategy for estimating data error rates and assessing enumerator performance during electronic data collection, which we term “validation relaxation.” Validation relaxation involves the intentional omission of data validation features for select questions to allow for data recording errors to be committed, detected, and monitored. Methods: We analyzed data collected during a cluster sample population survey in rural Liberia using an electronic data collection system (Open Data Kit). We first developed a classification scheme for types of detectable errors and validation alterations required to detect them. We then implemented the following validation relaxation techniques to enable data error conduct and detection: intentional redundancy, removal of “required” constraint, and illogical response combinations. This allowed for up to 11 identifiable errors to be made per survey. The error rate was defined as the total number of errors committed divided by the number of potential errors. We summarized crude error rates and estimated changes in error rates over time for both individuals and the entire program using logistic regression. Results: The aggregate error rate was 1.60% (125/7817). Error rates did not differ significantly between enumerators (P=.51), but decreased for the cohort with increasing days of application use, from 2.3% at survey start (95% CI 1.8%-2.8%) to 0.6% at day 45 (95% CI 0.3%-0.9%; OR=0.969; P$&amp;amp;amp;lt;$.001). The highest error rate (84/618, 13.6%) occurred for an intentional redundancy question for a birthdate field, which was repeated in separate sections of the survey. We found low error rates (0.0% to 3.1%) for all other possible errors. Conclusions: A strategy of removing validation rules on electronic data capture platforms can be used to create a set of detectable data errors, which can subsequently be used to assess group and individual enumerator error rates, their trends over time, and categories of data collection that require further training or additional quality control measures. This strategy may be particularly useful for identifying individual enumerators or systematic data errors that are responsive to enumerator training and is best applied to questions for which errors cannot be prevented through training or software design alone. Validation relaxation should be considered as a component of a holistic data quality assurance strategy.;,citation_author=Avi Kenny;,citation_author=Nicholas Gordon;,citation_author=Thomas Griffiths;,citation_author=John D Kraemer;,citation_author=Mark J Siedner;,citation_publication_date=2017-08;,citation_cover_date=2017-08;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.2196/jmir.7813;,citation_issn=1438-8871;,citation_volume=19;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Medical Internet Research;">

To examine the treatment effectiveness, both new charges as well as new convictions were used as outcome criteria. Results: Based on the first data source, the present study demonstrated that in the treatment group fewer charges for violent and sexual recidivism (14.2 % and 9.7 %, respectively) were reported than in the control group (26.9 % and 19.4 %, respectively). Based on the second data source, a significant treatment effect could not be observed. Discussion: The results of the present study indicate that even a decentralized allocation of treatment resources is basically able to contribute to the reduction of recidivism risk in released sexual offenders.;,citation_author=Achim Keßler;,citation_author=Martin Rettenberger;,citation_publication_date=2017-01;,citation_cover_date=2017-01;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1026/1616-3443/a000401;,citation_issn=1616-3443, 2190-6297;,citation_volume=46;,citation_language=de-DE;,citation_journal_title=Zeitschrift für Klinische Psychologie und Psychotherapie;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Preventing Child Sexual Abuse before It Occurs: Examining the Scale and Nature of Secondary Public Health Prevention Approaches;,citation_abstract=Preventing child sexual abuse (CSA) requires comprehensive multi-agency criminal justice and public health approaches. Yet, marginal attention has been given to secondary prevention strategies that target “at risk” populations. Thus, we carried out a scoping review examining secondary prevention interventions for people at risk of sexual offending by considering their effectiveness, challenges and barriers. We identified N = 43 sources and completed a qualitative analysis. Our appraisal found five themes: (a) essential features needed for secondary prevention programmes (plus summary of interventions); (b) barriers to examining, implementing and accessing secondary prevention programmes; (c) methodological limitations; (d) the ethical justification; and (e) economic benefits for preventing abuse before it occurs. Over the last two decades, sources report greater public tolerance to the notion of tackling CSA using public health prevention approaches. Thus, we call for policy makers to embrace this positive shift and invest resources to further examine this area. Practice impact statement Advancing clinicians’ and therapists’ practice is critical for those working with people at risk of harm. This review aims to strengthen current knowledge and inform practice. Further, policy makers and funders are essential to the development and progression of prevention strategies; by providing this contemporary review, we hope to assist the decision-making process for allocating resources and strengthening confidence in advancing policy that builds comprehensive prevention approaches.;,citation_author=Stephanie Kewley;,citation_author=Rosemary Mhlanga-Gunda;,citation_author=Marie-Claire Van Hout;,citation_publication_date=2023-01;,citation_cover_date=2023-01;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1080/13552600.2021.2000651;,citation_issn=1355-2600;,citation_volume=29;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Sexual Aggression;,citation_publisher=Routledge;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=MR-Eyetracker: A New Method for Eye Movement Recording in Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging;,citation_abstract=We present a method for recording saccadic and pursuit eye movements in the magnetic resonance tomograph designed for visual functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments. To reliably classify brain areas as pursuit or saccade related it is important to carefully measure the actual eye movements. For this purpose, infrared light, created outside the scanner by light-emitting diodes (LEDs), is guided via optic fibers into the head coil and onto the eye of the subject. Two additional fiber optical cables pick up the light reflected by the iris. The illuminating and detecting cables are mounted in a plastic eyepiece that is manually lowered to the level of the eye. By means of differential amplification, we obtain a signal that covaries with the horizontal position of the eye. Calibration of eye position within the scanner yields an estimate of eye position with a resolution of 0.2$^\circ$ at a sampling rate of 1000 Hz. Experiments are presented that employ echoplanar imaging with 12 image planes through visual, parietal and frontal cortex while subjects performed saccadic and pursuit eye movements. The distribution of BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) responses is shown to depend on the type of eye movement performed. Our method yields high temporal and spatial resolution of the horizontal component of eye movements during fMRI scanning. Since the signal is purely optical, there is no interaction between the eye movement signals and the echoplanar images. This reasonably priced eye tracker can be used to control eye position and monitor eye movements during fMRI.;,citation_author=H. Kimmig;,citation_author=M. W. Greenlee;,citation_author=F.

Some literature reviews conclude that treatment does not reduce recidivism while others suggest that specific types of treatment may warrant optimism. The principal purpose of this study is to update the most recent meta-analyses of sex offender treatments and to compare the findings with an earlier study that reviewed the meta-analytic studies published from 1995 to 2002. More importantly, this study examines effect sizes across different age populations and effect sizes across various sex offender treatments. Results of this review of meta-analyses suggest that sex offender treatments can be considered as “proven” or at least “promising,” while age of participants and intervention type may influence the success of treatment for sex offenders.

In the present prospective study, we evaluated the validity and utility of the SRM in a sample of 275 adult male sexual offenders treated within the Correctional Service of Canada. Results indicated that participation in treatment resulted in moderate to large sized improvements from pretreatment to posttreatment on a dynamic risk assessment measure and several self-reported treatment targets. These changes were, in some cases, differentially associated with self-regulation pathways, suggesting that offense pathway is a clinically relevant variable when evaluating treatment change and in conceptualizing sexual offender treatment. In terms of outcome, individuals following the approach pathways, particularly the approach-automatic pathway, demonstrated higher failure rates than individuals following avoidant pathways. However, many of these differences were less pronounced when taking risk for recidivism into account.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identifying the Added Value of Virtual Reality for Treatment in Forensic Mental Health: A Scenario-Based, Qualitative Approach;,citation_abstract=Background: Although literature and practice underline the potential of virtual reality (VR) for forensic mental healthcare, studies that explore why and in what way VR can be of added value for treatment of forensic psychiatric patients is lacking. Goals: This study aimed to identify (1) points of improvements in existing forensic mental health treatment of in- and outpatients, (2) possible ways of using VR that can improve current treatment, and (3) positive and negative aspects of the use of VR for the current treatment according to patients and therapists. Methods: Two scenario-based methods were used. First, semi-structured interviews were conducted with eight therapists and three patients to elicit scenarios from them. Based on these results, six scenarios about possibilities for using VR in treatment were created and presented to 89 therapists and 19 patients in an online questionnaire. The qualitative data from both methods were coded independently by two researchers, using the method of constant comparison. Results: In the interviews, six main codes with accompanying sub codes emerged. Ideas for improvement of treatment were grouped around the unique characteristics of the forensic setting, characteristics of the complex patient population, and characteristics of the type of treatment. For possibilities of VR, main codes were skills training with interaction, observation of situations or stimuli without interaction, and creating insight for others into the patient. The questionnaire resulted in a broad range of insights into potential positive and negative aspects of VR related to the current treatment, the patient, the content of a VR application, and practical matters. Conclusion: VR offers a broad range of possibilities for forensic mental health. Examples are offering training of behavioral and cognitive skills in a realistic context to bridge the gap between a therapy room and the real world, increasing treatment motivation, being able to adapt a VR application to individual patients, and providing therapists with new insights into a patient. These findings can be used to ground the development of new VR applications. Nevertheless, we should remain critical of when in the treatment process and for whom VR could be of added value.;,citation_author=Hanneke Kip;,citation_author=Saskia M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Integrating People, Context, and Technology in the Implementation of a Web-Based Intervention in Forensic Mental Health Care: Mixed-Methods Study;,citation_abstract=Background: While eMental health interventions can have many potential benefits for mental health care, implementation outcomes are often disappointing. In order to improve these outcomes, there is a need for a better understanding of complex, dynamic interactions between a broad range of implementation-related factors. These interactions and processes should be studied holistically, paying attention to factors related to context, technology, and people. Objective: The main objective of this mixed-method study was to holistically evaluate the implementation strategies and outcomes of an eMental health intervention in an organization for forensic mental health care. Methods: First, desk research was performed on 18 documents on the implementation process. Second, the intervention’s use by 721 patients and 172 therapists was analyzed via log data. Third, semistructured interviews were conducted with all 18 therapists of one outpatient clinic to identify broad factors that influence implementation outcomes. The interviews were analyzed via a combination of deductive analysis using the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework and inductive, open coding. Results: The timeline generated via desk research showed that implementation strategies focused on technical skills training of therapists. Log data analyses demonstrated that 1019 modules were started, and 18.65% (721/3865) of patients of the forensic hospital started at least one module. Of these patients, 18.0% (130/721) completed at least one module. Of the therapists using the module, 54.1% (93/172 sent at least one feedback message to a patient. The median number of feedback messages sent per therapist was 1, with a minimum of 0 and a maximum of 460. Interviews showed that therapists did not always introduce the intervention to patients and using the intervention was not part of their daily routine. Also, therapists indicated patients often did not have the required conscientiousness and literacy levels. Furthermore, they had mixed opinions about the design of the intervention. Important organization-related factors were the need for more support and better integration in organizational structures. Finally, therapists stated that despite its current low use, the intervention had the potential to improve the quality of treatment. Conclusions: Synthesis of different types of data showed that implementation outcomes were mostly disappointing. Implementation strategies focused on technical training of therapists, while little attention was paid to changes in the organization, design of the technology, and patient awareness. A more holistic approach toward implementation strategies—with more attention to the organization, patients, technology, and training therapists—might have resulted in better implementation outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effect of Virtual Reality Aggression Prevention Training for Forensic Psychiatric Patients (VRAPT): Study Protocol of a Multi-Center RCT;,citation_abstract=Background: Many patients residing in forensic psychiatric centers have difficulties regulating their aggression in an adequate manner. Therefore, they are frequently involved in conflicts. Evidenced-based aggression therapies in forensic psychiatry are scarce, and due to the highly secured environment, it is hard to practice real-life provocations. We have developed a Virtual Reality aggression prevention training (VRAPT), providing safe virtual environments, in which patients can practice controlling their aggressive behaviors in an adequate way. The main objective of this study is to examine whether VRAPT is effective in reducing aggression among forensic psychiatric inpatients. Methods: Four forensic psychiatric centers in the Netherlands are participating in this study. Participants will be randomly assigned to either VRAPT or a waiting list. The two groups will be compared at several different time points: baseline (12 weeks before intervention), pre-intervention, post-intervention and at 12 weeks follow-up. After follow-up measurements are completed, participants from the waiting list will also receive VRAPT. The primary outcome is level of aggressive behavior, consisting of staff-reported and self-reported measures. Secondary outcomes are self-report questionnaires on e.g., anger, impulsivity and aggression. Discussion: To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to examine the effectiveness of a VR aggression prevention training in forensic psychiatric centers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural Activations of the Acquisition of Conditioned Sexual Arousal: Effects of Contingency Awareness and Sex;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Learning processes like classical conditioning are involved in mediating sexual behavior. Yet, the neural bases underlying these processes have not been investigated so far. Aim. The aim of this study was to explore neural activations of classical conditioning of sexual arousal with respect to sex differences and contingency awareness. Methods. In the acquisition phase, a geometric figure (CS+) was presented for 8 seconds and was followed by highly sexual arousing pictures (UCS), whereas another figure (CS-) predicted neutral pictures. Ratings and contingency awareness were assessed after the entire conditioning procedure. Forty subjects (20 females) were classified into one of four groups according to their sex and the development of contingency awareness (aware females, aware males, unaware females, and unaware males). Main Outcome Measures. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), skin conductance responses (SCRs), and subjective ratings. Results. fMRI analysis showed two effects (awareness and sex) when comparing CS+ with CS-: (i) aware compared to unaware subjects showed enhanced differentiation (e.g., ventral striatum, orbitofrontal cortex, occipital cortex); and (ii) men showed increased activity compared to women in the amygdala, thalamus, and brainstem. CS+ and CSratings differed in aware subjects only. However, no conditioned SCRs occurred in any group. Conclusion. The increased activity in men is in line with theories postulating that men are generally more prone to conditioning of sexual arousal. Further, contingency awareness seems to be an important factor in appetitive learning processes, which facilitates conditioning processes.

Those metaanalyses revealed positive overall effects on reoffending of correctional treatment delivered in both settings. However, the treatment setting is also associated with complex moderator effects. With respect to effect size, for most groups, community-based correctional treatment is associated with statistically significant larger reductions in reoffending than treatments delivered in custodial settings. With respect to effect precision, custodial treatments report more consistent effects on reoffending than community-based treatments. The findings extend and develop the insight that treatment flexibility, such as is found among community-based treatments, can optimize program effectiveness. Likewise, the opportunities for monitoring and treatment fidelity that custodial settings enable can homogenize outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acceptance of Sexual Attraction and Its Link to Psychological Distress and Sexual Offending among Pedohebephilic Clients: Results from a Preliminary Analysis;,citation_abstract=Introduction Pedohebephilic disorder is characterized by intense sexual urges or fantasies involving children, which can lead to distress or sexual behavior with children. While theoretical and qualitative accounts suggest that accepting one’s pedohebephilic sexual interests may help mitigate both distress and problematic behaviors, the only published quantitative study to date has linked acceptance with behavior but did not analyze its effect on distress. Methods We examined the relationship between acceptance of sexual interests and child sexual abuse (CSA), the use of child sexual exploitation material (CSEM), and psychological distress in 238 pedohebephilic and teleiophilic men outside the judicial system (i.e., in the “Dunkelfeld”). Results Compared to teleiophilic individuals, pedohebephilic individuals showed lower acceptance of their sexual interests. No significant differences were found between groups regarding past sexual offending. In a subsample of 197 pedohebephilic individuals ( n  = 197), correlations with recent sexual behavior were minimal. In another subsample of pedohebephilic men ( n  = 84) with data on psychological distress, increased acceptance was associated with decreased psychological distress, although this association weakened among those reporting recent offenses. Discussion Acceptance of one’s sexual interests is associated with reduced distress in pedohebephilic disorder among non-offending individuals. However, its role among offending individuals remains unclear. Efforts to improve measuring the acceptance of one’s sexual interests and further explore its role in pedohebephilic disorder are warranted.;,citation_author=Anna Konrad;,citation_author=Laura Maria Heid;,citation_author=Hannah Scheuermann;,citation_author=Klaus Michael Beier;,citation_author=Till Amelung;,citation_publication_date=2025-01;,citation_cover_date=2025-01;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2024.1463191;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=15;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;">

Although helpful for mate detection, a chronic attentional bias towards attractive opposite-sex faces interferes with relationship initiation because it detracts from the current choice. Therefore, we hypothesized that an orienting of attention to attractive opposite-sex faces is inhibited as soon as a potential mating partner reciprocates one’s romantic feelings. Results of two experiments supported this idea: In a first study, imagining that an attractive person shows signs of reciprocal romantic interest eliminated automatic attentional capture by attractive opposite-sex faces. Similar results were obtained in a second study that analyzed intra-individual change in attentional biases during a longitudinal dating study.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Levels of Processing during Non-Conscious Perception: A Critical Review of Visual Masking;,citation_abstract=Understanding the extent and limits of non-conscious processing is an important step on the road to a thorough understanding of the cognitive and cerebral correlates of conscious perception. In this article, we present a critical review of research on subliminal perception during masking and other related experimental conditions. Although initially controversial, the possibility that a broad variety of processes can be activated by a non-reportable stimulus is now well established. Behavioural findings of subliminal priming indicate that a masked word or digit can have an influence on perceptual, lexical and semantic levels, while neuroimaging directly visualizes the brain activation that it evokes in several cortical areas. This activation is often attenuated under subliminal presentation conditions compared to consciously reportable conditions, but there are sufficiently many exceptions, in paradigms such as the attentional blink, to indicate that high activation, per se , is not a sufficient condition for conscious access to occur. We conclude by arguing that for a stimulus to reach consciousness, two factors are jointly needed: (i) the input stimulus must have enough strength (which can be prevented by masking) and (ii) it must receive top-down attention (which can be prevented by drawing attention to another stimulus or task). This view leads to a distinction between two types of non-conscious processes, which we call subliminal and preconscious. According to us, maintaining this distinction is essential in order to make sense of the growing neuroimaging data on the neural correlates of consciousness.;,citation_author=Sid Kouider;,citation_author=Stanislas Dehaene;,citation_publication_date=2007-05;,citation_cover_date=2007-05;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=1481;,citation_doi=10.1098/rstb.2007.2093;,citation_issn=0962-8436, 1471-2970;,citation_volume=362;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Habituation of Male Sexual Arousal: Effects of Attentional Focus;,citation_abstract=Three experiments are reported demonstrating that levels of penile tumescence and subjective sexual arousal are greater when men employ participant-oriented rather than spectator-oriented attentional focus while viewing an erotic film segment. Under each instructional set, there was a reduction in sexual arousal during repeated erotic stimulation. As sexual arousal habituated, the men reported feeling less absorbed during erotic stimulation. When these associated changes in attentional focus (absorption) were partialled out through analysis of covariance, sexual arousal remained relatively stable over trials, suggesting that sexual arousal is less likely to habituate if attentional focus remains constant during repeated erotic stimulation.

Focus over the past 25 years has remained on the fundamental and classical questions: What are the mechanisms that keep gaze stable with either stationary or moving targets? How does the motion of the image on the retina affect vision? Where do we look – and why – when performing a complex task? How can the world appear clear and stable despite continual movements of the eyes? The past 25 years of investigation of these questions has seen progress and transformations at all levels due to new approaches (behavioral, neural and theoretical) aimed at studying how eye movements cope with realworld visual and cognitive demands.

To this end, this research explored several high-level social phenomena in a simple, inexpensive computer-game environment: the reduced likelihood of helping under time pressure and the bystander effect, which is reduced helping in the presence of bystanders. In the first experiment, participants had to find the exit in a virtual labyrinth under either high or low time pressure. They encountered rooms with and without virtual bystanders, and in each room, a virtual person requested assistance. Participants helped significantly less frequently under time pressure but the presence=absence of a small number of bystanders did not significantly moderate helping. The second experiment increased the number of virtual bystanders, and participants were instructed to imagine that these were real people. Participants helped significantly less in rooms with large numbers of bystanders compared to rooms with no bystanders, thus demonstrating a bystander effect. These results indicate that even sophisticated highlevel social behaviors can be observed and experimentally manipulated in simple VEs, thus implying the broad usefulness of this paradigm in psychological research as a good compromise between experimental control and ecological validity.;,citation_author=Michail D.

Due to the sexualized incentives and the recurring descriptions of sexual acts presented in the stories, children were exposed by the authors in a way that should be prosecuted under German law (§ 184b German Criminal Code, StGB). As measured by the Combating Paedophile Information Networks in Europe (COPINE) scale (Taylor et al. 2001), the severity of child sexual abuse depicted in the “girl lover” stories ($&amp;amp;amp;gt;$ 8) is notably higher than in previously evaluated image-based and video-based child sexual abuse material collections (e.g., Fortin and Proulx 2019) that depicted children of comparable ages (at just under 10 years old; COPINE = 4–6). In addition, the stories from the “girl lover” forum that were examined often contained the authors’ assumptions about how children experience sexual acts. Here, cognitive distortions are unmistakable, especially false assumptions about interest in and physical reactions to sexual acts by children, about consensual sexual contact and romantic attachment, and representations in which the child is reduced to an adult sexual object available at any time. In conclusion, we argue that the risk posed by the stories is that their consumption can stimulate fantasies of child sexual abuse and reinforce cognitive distortions of the normality of child sexual abuse behavior.;,citation_author=Uwe Krähnke;,citation_author=Lilian Hurst;,citation_author=Judith Schumann;,citation_author=Salla Huikuri;,citation_author=Julia Bussweiler;,citation_author=Robert Lehmann;,citation_publication_date=2023-11;,citation_cover_date=2023-11;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11757-023-00791-7;,citation_issn=1862-7072, 1862-7080;,citation_volume=17;,citation_language=de-DE;,citation_journal_title=Forensische Psychiatrie, Psychologie, Kriminologie;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Size of Treatment Effects and Their Importance to Clinical Research and Practice;,citation_abstract=In randomized clinical trails (RCTs), effect sizes seen in earlier studies guide both the choice of the effect size that sets the appropriate threshold of clinical significance and the rationale to believe that the true effect size is above that threshold worth pursuing in an RCT. That threshold is used to determine the necessary sample size for the proposed RCT. Once the RCT is done, the data generated are used to estimate the true effect size and its confidence interval. Clinical significance is assessed by comparing the true effect size to the threshold effect size. In subsequent meta-analysis, this effect size is combined with others, ultimately to determine whether treatment (T) is clinically significantly better than control (C). Thus, effect sizes play an important role both in designing RCTs and in interpreting their results; but specifically which effect size? We review the principles of statistical significance, power, and meta-analysis, and commonly used effect sizes. The commonly used effect sizes are limited in conveying clinical significance. We recommend three equivalent effect sizes: number needed to treat, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve comparing T and C responses, and success rate difference, chosen specifically to convey clinical significance.;,citation_author=Helena Chmura Kraemer;,citation_author=David J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Being Bullied in Virtual Environments: Experiences and Reactions of Male and Female Students to a Male or Female Oppressor;,citation_abstract=Bullying is a pressing societal problem. As such, it is important to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in bullying and of resilience factors which might protect victims. Moreover, it is necessary to provide tools that can train potential victims to strengthen their resilience. To facilitate both of these goals, the current study tests a recently developed virtual environment that puts participants in the role of a victim who is being oppressed by a superior. In a 2  2 between-subjects experiment (N = 81), we measured the effects of gender of the oppressor and gender of the participant on psychophysiological reactions, subjective experiences and willingness to report the event. The results reveal that even when a male and a female bully show the exact same behavior, the male bully is perceived as more threatening. In terms of gender of the victim, the only difference that emerged was a more pronounced increase in heart rate in males. The results were moderated by the personality factors social gender, neuroticism, and need to belong, while self-esteem did not show any moderating influence.;,citation_author=Nicole Krämer;,citation_author=Sabrina Sobieraj;,citation_author=Dan Feng;,citation_author=Elisabeth Trubina;,citation_author=Stacy Marsella;,citation_publication_date=2018-03;,citation_cover_date=2018-03;,citation_year=2018;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00253;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Face Perception Is Modulated by Sexual Preference;,citation_abstract=Face perception is mediated by a distributed neural system in the human brain [1, 2]. The response to faces is modulated by cognitive factors such as attention, visual imagery, and emotion [3–6]; however, the effects of gender and sexual orientation are currently unknown. We used fMRI to test whether subjects would respond more to their sexually preferred faces and predicted such modulation in the reward circuitry. Forty heterosexual and homosexual men and women viewed photographs of male and female faces and assessed facial attractiveness. Regardless of their gender and sexual orientation, all subjects similarly rated the attractiveness of both male and female faces. Within multiple, bilateral face-selective regions in the visual cortex, limbic system, and prefrontal cortex, similar patterns of activation were found in all subjects in response to both male and female faces. Consistent with our hypothesis, we found a significant interaction between stimulus gender and the sexual preference of the subject in the thalamus and medial orbitofrontal cortex, where heterosexual men and homosexual women responded more to female faces and heterosexual women and homosexual men responded more to male faces. Our findings suggest that sexual preference modulates face-evoked activation in the reward circuitry.;,citation_author=Felicitas Kranz;,citation_author=Alumit Ishai;,citation_publication_date=2006-01;,citation_cover_date=2006-01;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.10.070;,citation_issn=09609822;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Current Biology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neurocognitive and Personality Factors in Homo- and Heterosexual Pedophiles and Controls;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Several neuropsychological studies have suggested an association between pedophilia, neurocognitive disturbances, and specific personality profiles. However, inconsistencies in the findings have not been explained sufficiently, because many studies did not control for possible confounding factors, such as age, education level, or gender orientation. Aim. Therefore, the present investigation examined neurocognitive performance and personality profiles in pedophiles in dependence of sexual gender preferences and sexual deviance, as well as with regard to age and education level. Main Outcome Measures. Scores on the different neurocognitive tests, personality questionnaires, and Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-IV (SCID) interviews. Methods. An extensive neurocognitive test battery (including a reduced version of the German Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, the Wisconsin card-sorting test, d2 Attention-Deficit Test, and the Corsi block-tapping test) as well as two personality questionnaires (Minnessota Multiphasic Personality Inventory [MMPI-2] and the Multiphasic Sex Inventory [MSI]) were used to examine a consecutive sample of 20 psychiatrically assessed (SCID I and II) pedophile inpatients (nine exclusively attracted to females and 11 to males) from two high security forensic hospitals and 28 healthy controls (14 heterosexual, 14 homosexual). Results. Compared with controls, pedophiles showed neurocognitive impairments and personality specifics in the majority of tests and questionnaires, such as reduced values on the intelligence scale and weaker performances in information processing, together with high scores for psychopathy and paranoia, and signs of sexual obsessiveness and sexual dysfunction. In contrast to previous reports, some of these alterations were at least partly explained by factors other than pedophilia, such as education level or age. Conclusion. These alterations may be seen to be in line with the hypothesis of a perturbation of neurodevelopment in early life. These results enhance our knowledge about pedophilia-associated impairment in neurocognitive functioning and personality structure insofar as they allow a more detailed description of, and insight into, modulatory factors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Quantitative Meta-Analysis on Cue-Induced Male Sexual Arousal;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Visually induced sexual arousal is a common occurrence in human behavior. The cerebral underpinnings of this response have been explored in recent neuroimaging studies. Aim. We set out to test the strength of evidence for the presence of a core network of brain regions involved in male sexual arousal elicited by erotic stimuli. Methods. Eleven functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that presented erotic visual stimuli and compared the associated brain activity with the brain activity elicited by neutral visual stimuli were identified. Main Outcomes Measures. Activation likelihood estimation was employed to perform quantitative meta-analyses on coordinates of brain activation in order to assess significant concordance across studies. Results. The meta-analysis included studies on heterosexual males and revealed consistent activation in the hypothalamus, thalamus, amygdala, anterior cingulate gyrus (ACC), insula, fusiform gyrus, precentral gyrus, parietal cortex, and occipital cortex across studies. Moreover, we explored brain responses associated with a physiological marker of sexual arousal (penile tumescence) and found concurrence in hypothalamus, thalamus, bilateral insula, ACC, postcentral gyrus, and occipital gyrus. Conclusions. This is the first quantitative meta-analysis on sexual cue reactivity and identifies a neural network consisting of cognitive (parietal cortex, ACC, thalamus, insula), emotional (amygdala, insula), motivational (precentral gyrus, parietal cortex), and physiological (hypothalamus/thalamus, insula) components constituting a core circuit of male sexual arousal in humans.

The multimodal integration model of the brain can provide a theoretical background from which one can approach multimodal stimulus integration. In this study, we suggest a virtual reality system for the multi-modal assessment of cognitive ability of schizophrenia patients. The virtual reality system can provide multimodal stimuli, such as visual and auditory stimuli, to the patient and can evaluate the patient’s multimodal integration and working memory integration abilities by making the patient interpret and react to multimodal stimuli, which must be remembered for a given period of time. The clinical study showed that the virtual reality program developed is comparable to those of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) and the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), and it provides some information related to the schizophrenic patients’ behavior in 3D virtual environment.;,citation_author=Jeonghun Ku;,citation_author=Wongeun Cho;,citation_author=Jae-Jin Kim;,citation_author=Avi Peled;,citation_author=Brenda K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Emotional Curiosity: Modulation of Visuospatial Attention by Arousal Is Preserved in Aging and Early-Stage Alzheimer’s Disease;,citation_abstract=Previous studies have shown that Alzheimer’s disease, even in its early stages, decreases novelty-seeking behaviors (curiosity) and impairs the shifting of spatial attention to extrapersonal targets. In this study, early-stage probable Alzheimer’s disease patients (PRAD) and young and aging controls were shown pairs of visual scenes, some of which contained emotionally-arousing material, while eye movements were recorded under free viewing conditions. In all three subject groups, emotionally-arousing scenes attracted more viewing time and also became the preferential target of the initial visual orientation. Our findings suggest that the arousing properties of sensory stimuli may overcome some of the AD-related impairments in the distribution of attention to extrapersonal targets.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Women’s Pupillary Responses to Sexually Significant Others during the Hormonal Cycle;,citation_abstract=Women’s sexual preferences can change over the hormonal cycle, as several studies, based on responses to questionnaires, diaries, and ratings of photographs, have indicated increased sexual interests around the time of ovulation. However, fewer studies have measured changes in attention or interest to sexually significant stimuli in terms of physiological responses that are not under voluntary control and measure sexual interest indirectly (i.e., without mention of sexual feelings or activities). In the present study, we indexed changes in sexual interest in terms of changes in the eye pupil’s size. Pupillary diameter is known to have a proportional relation to the observer’s level of interest and attention to a visual stimulus as well as to physical pleasure. Fourteen women (7 being “pill” users) viewed photos on a computer screen while their pupil diameters were recorded using an infrared eye-tracking device. Three measures were taken for each participant during three time windows that estimated the ovulatory, luteal, and menstrual phase of the cycle. We found an increase in mean pupil diameter for sexually significant stimuli during the fertile phase and this pupillary change was also specific to pictures of the participants’ actual sexual partners. Moreover, this effect was only seen for women who did not use oral contraceptives. These findings confirm that women’s attention for sexually significant stimuli is higher during their fertile phase of the menstrual cycle, and that changes in sexual interest are implicitly measurable using pupillometry.;,citation_author=B Laeng;,citation_author=L Falkenberg;,citation_publication_date=2007-11;,citation_cover_date=2007-11;,citation_year=2007;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2007.07.013;,citation_issn=0018506X;,citation_volume=52;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Hormones and Behavior;">

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was the mean change between baseline and 2 weeks in the composite risk score of 5 domains of child sexual abuse ranging from 0 to 15 points; each domain could be rated from 0 to 3 points. Secondary end points included efficacy at 2 and 10 weeks as measured by the composite score, each risk domain, quality of life, self-reported effects, and adverse events. RESULTS A total of 52 male participants (mean [SD] age, 36 [12] years) were randomized to receive either degarelix (n = 25; with 1 withdrawal) or placebo (n = 26). At 2 weeks, the composite risk score decreased from 7.4 to 4.4 for participants in the degarelix group and from 7.8 to 6.6 for the placebo group, a mean between-group difference of –1.8 (95% CI, –3.2 to –0.5; P = .01). A decrease was seen in the composite score at 10 weeks (-2.2 [95% CI, -3.6 to -0.7]) as well as in the domains of pedophilic disorder (2 weeks: -0.7 [95% CI, -1.4 to 0.0]; 10 weeks: -1.1 [95% CI, -1.8 to -0.4]) and sexual preoccupation (2 weeks: -0.7 [95% CI, -1.2 to -0.3]; 10 weeks: -0.8 [95% CI, -1.3 to -0.3]) in the degarelix group compared with the placebo group. No difference was seen for the domains of self-rated risk (2 weeks: -0.4 [95% CI, -0.9 to 0.1]; 10 weeks: -0.5 [95% CI, -1 to 0.0]), low empathy (2 weeks: 0.2 [95% CI, -0.3 to 0.6]; 10 weeks: 0.2 [95% CI, -0.2 to 0.6]), and impaired self-regulation (2 weeks: -0.0 [95% CI, -0.7 to 0.6]; 10 weeks: 0.1 [95% CI, -0.5 to 0.8]), or quality of life (EuroQol 5 Dimensions questionnaire index score, 2 weeks: 0.06 [95% CI, -0.00 to 0.12], and 10 weeks: 0.04; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.10; EuroQol visual analog scale, 2 weeks: 0.6 [95% CI, -9.7 to 10.9], and 10 weeks: 4.2 [95% CI, -6.0 to 14.4]). Two hospitalizations occurred from increased suicidal ideation, and more injection site reactions (degarelix: 22 of 25 [88%]; placebo: 1 of 26 [4%]) and hepatobiliary enzyme level elevations were reported by participants who received degarelix (degarelix: 11 of 25 [44%]; placebo: 2 of 26 [8%]). Among the 26 participants randomized to receive degarelix, 20 (77%) experienced positive effects (eg, improved attitude or behavior) on sexuality and 23 (89%) reported adverse effects on the body. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE This trial found that degarelix reduced the risk score for committing child sexual abuse in men with pedophilic disorder 2 weeks after initial injection, suggesting use of the drug as a rapid-onset treatment option. Further studies are warranted into the effects and long-term adverse effects of hormone deficiency.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Pharmacological Treatment for Pedophilic Disorder and Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder: A Review;,citation_abstract=Guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of paraphilic disorders have historically been based on data from forensic settings and on risk levels for sexual crime. However, emerging treatment options are being evaluated for individuals experiencing distress because of their sexual urges and preferences, targeting both paraphilic disorders such as pedophilic disorder (PeD) and the new diagnosis of compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD) included in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11). As in other mental disorders, this may enable individualized pharmacological treatment plans, taking into account components of sexuality (e.g. high libido, compulsivity, anxiety-driven/sex as coping), medical and psychiatric comorbidity, adverse effects and patient preferences. In order to expand on previous reviews, we conducted a literature search focusing on randomized controlled trials of pharmacological treatment for persons likely to have PeD or CSBD. Our search was not restricted to studies involving forensic or criminal samples. Twelve studies conducted between 1974 and 2021 were identified regardless of setting (outpatient or inpatient), with only one study conducted during the last decade. Of a total of 213 participants included in these studies, 122 (57%) were likely to have PeD, 34 (16%) were likely to have a CSBD, and the remainder had unspecified paraphilias (40, 21%) or sexual offense (17, 8%) as the treatment indication. The diagnostic procedure for PeD and/or CSBD, as well as comorbid psychiatric symptoms, has been described in seven studies. The studies provide some empirical evidence that testosterone-lowering drugs reduce sexual activity for patients with PeD or CSBD, but the body of evidence is meager. There is a need for studies using larger samples, specific criteria for inclusion, longer follow-up periods, and standardized outcome measures with adherence to international reporting guidelines.;,citation_author=Valdemar Landgren;,citation_author=Josephine Savard;,citation_author=Cecilia Dhejne;,citation_author=Jussi Jokinen;,citation_author=Stefan Arver;,citation_author=Michael C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Knowledge Base of the Oculomotor System;,citation_abstract=In everyday life, eye movements enable the eyes to gather the information required for motor actions. They are thus proactive, anticipating actions rather than just responding to stimuli. This means that the oculomotor system needs to know where to look and what to look for. Using examples from table tennis, driving and music reading we show that the information the eye movement system requires is very varied in origin and highly task specific, and it is suggested that the control program or schema for a particular action must include directions for the oculomotor and visual processing systems. In many activities (reading text and music, typing, steering) processed information is held in a memory buffer for a period of about a second. This permits a match between the discontinuous input from the eyes and continuous motor output, and in particular allows the eyes to be involved in more than one task.;,citation_author=Michael F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Telling Truth from Lie in Individual Subjects with Fast Event-Related fMRI;,citation_abstract=Deception is a clinically important behavior with poorly understood neurobiological correlates. Published functional MRI (fMRI) data on the brain activity during deception indicates that, on a multisubject group level, lie is distinguished from truth by increased prefrontal and parietal activity. These findings are theoretically important; however, their applied value will be determined by the accuracy of the discrimination between single deceptive and truthful responses in individual subjects. This study presents the first quantitative estimate of the accuracy of fMRI in conjunction with a formal forced-choice paradigm in detecting deception in individual subjects. We used a paradigm balancing the salience of the target cues to elicit deceptive and truthful responses and determined the accuracy of this model in the classification of single lie and truth events. The relative salience of the task cues affected the net activation associated with lie in the superior medial and inferolateral prefrontal cortices. Lie was discriminated from truth on a single-event level with an accuracy of 78%, while the predictive ability expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC) was 85%. Our findings confirm that fMRI, in conjunction with a carefully controlled query procedure, could be used to detect deception in individual subjects. Salience of the task cues is a potential confounding factor in the fMRI pattern attributed to deception in forced choice deception paradigms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=True Lies: Delusions and Lie-Detection Technology;,citation_abstract=Legally relevant lying is an intentional attempt to convince another of the truth of a proposition the liar believes to be false. Delusion is an unintentional product of impaired reality testing that occurs in a range of psychiatric conditions and psychological states, some of which could be clinically subtle. Since deception, truth and delusion differ in the intent rather than reality testing criterion. Deception and delusion are influenced by the degree of congruence between subjective and objective reality and are probably mutually exclusive. Thus, a delusion could lead to an objectively false statement, that could nevertheless be subjectively true and indistinguishable from truth by its psychophysiological (i.e., the polygraph) signature. This article presents a relevant case as a starting point of an examination of the current and future role of neurophysiological (i.e., functional brain imaging) measurements in the detection of deception. The authors incorporate the recent data on functional brain imaging to the neuroanatomical mechanisms of true and false recall, behavioral regulation and deception into a testable model that could redefine deception and separate it from delusions on the basis of objective functional brain imaging measures.;,citation_author=Daniel D.

Judgments relating to pleasure, arousal, interest, and emotional state were measured, as was choice viewing time. Significant covariation was obtained between (a) facial expression and affective valence judgments and (b) skin conductance magnitude and arousal ratings. Interest ratings and viewing time were also associated with arousal. Although differences due to the subject’s gender and cognitive style were obtained, affective responses were largely independent of the personality factors investigated. Response specificity, particularly facial expressiveness, supported the view that specific affects have unique patterns of reactivity. The consistency of the dimensional relationships between evaluative judgments (i.e., pleasure and arousal) and physiological response, however, emphasizes that emotion is fundamentally organized by these motivational parameters.;,citation_author=Peter J.

Design Systematic review of interventions designed to prevent reoffending among known abusers and prevention for individuals at risk of sexually abusing children. Randomised controlled trials and prospective observational studies were eligible. Primary outcomes were arrests, convictions, breaches of conditions, and self reported sexual abuse of children after one year or more. Results After review of 1447 abstracts, we retrieved 167 full text studies, and finally included eight studies with low to moderate risk of bias. We found weak evidence for interventions aimed at reducing reoffending in identified sexual abusers of children. For adults, evidence from five trials was insufficient regarding both benefits and risks with psychological treatment and pharmacotherapy. For adolescents, limited evidence from one trial suggested that multisystemic therapy prevented reoffence (relative risk 0.18, 95% confidence interval 0.04 to 0.73); lack of adequate research prevented conclusions about effects of other treatments. Evidence was also inadequate regarding effectiveness of treatment for children with sexual behavioural problems in the one trial identified. Finally, we found no eligible research on preventive methods for adults and adolescents who had not sexually abused children but were at higher risk of doing so (such as those with paedophilic sexual preference).

Objective: To investigate whether Prevent It, a therapist-supported, internet-delivered, eight-week, cognitive behavioral therapy, reduces CSAM viewing among users. Methods: We conducted a global online single-blind (participants), parallel-group, superiority, randomized, psychological placebo-controlled trial with a one-month follow-up, 2019–2021 (ISRCTN76841676). We recruited anonymous participants, mainly from Darknet forums. Inclusion criteria: age 18+ years, past week CSAM use, and sufficient English language skills; exclusion criteria: severe psychiatric illness or non-serious intent to participate. The main outcome was change in self-reported, weekly viewing time from pre- to posttreatment, according to the Sexual Child Molestation Risk Assessment+. Results: A total of 160 participants (157 male, 2 non-binary, and 1 not reporting gender) from all world regions (age intervals [%]: 18–29 [49]; 30–39 [30]; 40–49 [15]; 50–59 [6]) were randomized (1:1) to Prevent It (N = 80) or Placebo (N = 80).

V. has been designing and testing the computer-based training “OHA—Online Hass Abbauen (reduce hate online)” since 2015. In the present study, the effectiveness of the submodule “offenses and violence” was evaluated in a controlled pre-post design. The intervention group participated in a 1-week digital training aimed at raising aggression thresholds by strengthening empathy and working on cognitive neutralization or justification strategies to legitimize aggressive behavior. In total, data were collected from 76 male adolescents from 2 juvenile detention centers in 2 German states. All participants completed two parallel forms of the empathy scale and the aggression legitimation scale of the FEPAA (Questionnaire or the assessment of empathy, prosociality, aggressiveness and violent behaviour) within 1 week, with training in the intervention group occurring between the two time points. In the variance analytical evaluation of the test results, significant improvements in both target criteria were calculated in the intervention group. Similar high effects were obtained as in comparable cognitive behavioral measures with face-to-face approaches (d 0.65). Particularly high effects were obtained in both measures for youths with existing relevant violent offenses. The results suggest that the training is directly effective. at least at the dispositional level. Since the correlation between the dispositions assessed and aggressive behavior is empirically substantiated, a positive influence on aggressive and violent behavior seems plausible. The training can be evaluated as promising due to the results as well as the simple and flexible handling with standardized implementation quality and the potential to generate high motivation and self-efficacy expectations of the participants.;,citation_author=Johannes Lautenbacher;,citation_author=Sara Jahnke;,citation_author=Daniel Speer;,citation_author=Andreas Beelmann;,citation_language=de-DE;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cue-Exposure Therapy to Decrease Alcohol Craving in Virtual Environment;,citation_abstract=During abstinence from alcohol, craving is elicited by the cues and contexts previously associated with alcohol, which contribute to relapse. To prevent the craving and relapse experienced by alcoholics, cue-exposure therapy (CET) has been used to extinguish the association between alcohol and alcohol-related cues and contexts. This study applied CET, using a virtual reality (VR) system, to eight members of an Alcoholics Anonymous group for eight sessions. Cues and contexts most likely to elicit an urge to drink were selected through a preliminary survey in order to compose VR-CET scenarios: a glass, a bottle, food, and a bar were judged to be the most tempting for people in alcohol dependence and abstinence. Using these cues and contexts, a Japanese-style pub and a western bar were created. Each session was administered for 30 minutes by a psychiatrist and included an introduction, immersion, VR navigation, interviews about feelings, and self-report questionnaires about cravings. The eight sessions consisted of initial and closing sessions and person-, object-, and situation-focused sessions. As a result, a reduction in cue-elicited craving after VR-CET was reported. A mean score of 15.75 (SD ؍ 10.91) on the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire in the first session decreased to 11.50 (SD ؍ 5.76) in the final session.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Conducting Randomized Controlled Trials of Complex Interventions in Prisons: A Sisyphean Task?;,citation_abstract=Randomized Controlled Trials (RCT) are the “gold standard” for measuring the effectiveness of an intervention. However, they have their limitations and are especially complex in prison settings. Several systematic reviews have highlighted some of the issues, including, institutional constraints e.g., “lock-downs,” follow-ups, contamination of allocation conditions and a reliance on self-report measures. In this article, we reflect on our experiences and will describe two RCTs. People in prison are a significantly disadvantaged and vulnerable group, ensuring equitable and effective interventions is key to reducing inequality and promoting positive outcomes. We ask are RCTs of complex interventions in prisons a sisyphean task? We certainly don’t think so, but we propose that current accepted practice and research designs may be limiting our understanding and ability to test complex interventions in the real-world context of prisons. RCTs will always have their place, but designs need to be flexible and adaptive, with the development of other rigorous methods for evaluating impact of interventions e.g., nonrandomized studies, including pre-post implementation studies. With robust research we can deliver quality evidence-based healthcare in prisons – after all the degree of civilization in a society is revealed by entering its prisons.;,citation_author=Charlotte Lennox;,citation_author=Sarah Leonard;,citation_author=Jane Senior;,citation_author=Caroline Hendricks;,citation_author=Sarah Rybczynska-Bunt;,citation_author=Cath Quinn;,citation_author=Richard Byng;,citation_author=Jenny Shaw;,citation_publication_date=2022-05;,citation_cover_date=2022-05;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2022.839958;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;">

The ITC-Sense of Presence Inventory (ITC-SOPI) is a new state questionnaire measure whose development has been informed by previous research on the determinants of presence and current self-report measures. It focuses on users’ experiences of media, with no reference to objective system parameters. More than 600 people completed the ITC-SOPI following an experience with one of a range of noninteractive and interactive media. Exploratory analysis (principal axis factoring) revealed four factors: Sense of Physical Space, Engagement, Ecological Validity, and Negative Effects. Relations between the factors and the consistency of the factor structure with others reported in the literature are discussed. Preliminary analyses described here demonstrate that the ITC-SOPI is reliable and valid, but more rigorous testing of its psychometric properties and applicability to interactive virtual environments is required. Subject to satisfactory confirmatory analyses, the ITC-SOPI will offer researchers using a range of media systems a tool with which to measure four facets of a media experience that are putatively related to presence.;,citation_author=Jane Lessiter;,citation_author=Jonathan Freeman;,citation_author=Edmund Keogh;,citation_author=Jules Davidoff;,citation_publication_date=2001-06;,citation_cover_date=2001-06;,citation_year=2001;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1162/105474601300343612;,citation_issn=1054-7460;,citation_volume=10;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments;">

Aims: The purpose of this study was to review the existing research data assessing the efficacy of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists for treating adult, male, sexual offenders. Method: The method of this review involved the examination of studies involving participants prescribed at least one month of a gonadotrophinreleasing hormone agonist for the purposes of reducing sexual drive related to offending. The primary outcome measures were recidivism rates and sexual functioning. Secondary outcome measures included assessment of side effects and effects on interpersonal/psychiatric functioning. Studies in the English language that were dated 1969–2015 were included. Results: Twelve eligible studies (323 participants) were identified. A reduction in a variety of measures of sexual functioning and/or risk was found in all studies. Robust recidivism data was limited. Medication was rarely described as ineffectual. All studies reported side effects. Reduction in bone density and potential long-term reduction in fertility in some subjects were issues of concern. Conclusion: Whilst identified studies showed promising results with respect to sexual functioning, challenges in performing randomised control trials in this subject group meant that included studies were methodologically limited. This review recommends that future research must be performed before the effectiveness and tolerability of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists in this population can be confirmed.;,citation_author=Alexandra Lewis;,citation_author=Don Grubin;,citation_author=Callum C Ross;,citation_author=Mrigendra Das;,citation_publication_date=2017-10;,citation_cover_date=2017-10;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1177/0269881117714048;,citation_issn=0269-8811, 1461-7285;,citation_volume=31;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Psychopharmacology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is Virtually Everything Possible? The Relevance of Ethics and Human Rights for Introducing Extended Reality in Forensic Psychiatry;,citation_abstract=Extended Reality (XR) systems, such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR), provide a digital simulation either of a complete environment, or of particular objects within the real world. Today, XR is used in a wide variety of settings, including gaming, design, engineering, and the military. In addition, XR has been introduced into psychology, cognitive sciences and biomedicine for both basic research as well as diagnosing or treating neurological and psychiatric disorders. In the context of XR, the simulated “reality” can be controlled and people may safely learn to cope with their feelings and behavior. XR also enables to simulate environments that cannot easily be accessed or created otherwise. Therefore, Extended Reality systems are thought to be a promising tool in the resocialization of criminal offenders, more specifically for purposes of risk assessment and treatment of forensic patients. Employing XR in forensic settings raises ethical and legal intricacies which are not raised in case of most other healthcare applications. Whereas a variety of normative issues of XR have been discussed in the context of medicine and consumer usage, the debate on XR in forensic settings is, as yet, straggling. By discussing two general arguments in favor of employing XR in criminal justice, and two arguments calling for caution in this regard, the present paper aims to broaden the current ethical and legal debate on XR applications to their use in the resocialization of criminal offenders, mainly focusing on forensic patients.;,citation_author=Sjors Ligthart;,citation_author=Gerben Meynen;,citation_author=Nikola Biller-Andorno;,citation_author=Tijs Kooijmans;,citation_author=Philipp Kellmeyer;,citation_publication_date=2021-03;,citation_cover_date=2021-03;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.1080/21507740.2021.1898489;,citation_issn=2150-7740, 2150-7759;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=AJOB Neuroscience;">

However, since the development of the original scale, the VR technology significantly changed. We aimed to respond to that change and revalidate the original measure in the contemporary setting. For the purpose of scale validation, data was gathered from six studies with 720 participants in total. Five experiments and one online survey were conducted to examine psychometric properties of the scale in accordance with the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing. Evidence based on internal structure, relations to other variables and test content was obtained. The factorial structure of the original scale was tested and confirmed. The connections between realism and immersion, presence, aesthetics were verified. A suppressed relationship between realism and positive affect was discovered. Moreover, it was confirmed that scale result is dependent on the quality of VR graphics. Results of the analyses provide the evidence that the VR Simulation Realism Scale is a well-established tool that might be used both in science and in VR development.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Effectiveness of Correctional Rehabilitation: A Review of Systematic Reviews;,citation_abstract=The effects of correctional interventions on recidivism have important public safety implications when offenders are released from probation or prison. Hundreds of studies have been conducted on those effects, some investigating punitive approaches and some investigating rehabilitation treatments. Systematic reviews (meta-analyses) of those studies, while varying greatly in coverage and technique, display remarkable consistency in their overall findings. Supervision and sanctions, at best, show modest mean reductions in recidivism and, in some instances, have the opposite effect and increase reoffense rates. The mean recidivism effects found in studies of rehabilitation treatment, by comparison, are consistently positive and relatively large. There is, however, considerable variability in those effects associated with the type of treatment, how well it is implemented, and the nature of the offenders to whom it is applied. The specific sources of that variability have not been well explored, but some principles for effective treatment have emerged. The rehabilitation treatments generally found effective in research do not characterize current correctional practice, and bridging the gap between research and practice remains a significant challenge.;,citation_author=Mark W.

Random response is a very common aberrant response behavior in personality tests and may negatively affect the reliability, validity, or other analytical aspects of psychological assessment. Typically, researchers use a single person-fit index to identify random responses. This study recommends a three-step person-fit analysis procedure. Unlike the typical single person-fit methods, the three-step procedure identifies both global misfit and local misfit individuals using different person-fit indices. This procedure was able to identify more local misfit individuals than single-index method, and a graphical method was used to visualize those particular items in which random response behaviors appear. This method may be useful to researchers in that it will provide them with more information about response behaviors, allowing better evaluation of scale administration and development of more plausible explanations. Real data were used in this study instead of simulation data. In order to create real random responses, an experimental test administration was designed. Four different random response samples were produced using this experimental system.;,citation_author=Tour Liu;,citation_author=Tian Lan;,citation_author=Tao Xin;,citation_publication_date=2019-01;,citation_cover_date=2019-01;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1027/1015-5759/a000369;,citation_issn=1015-5759;,citation_volume=35;,citation_journal_title=European Journal of Psychological Assessment;,citation_publisher=Hogrefe Publishing;">

Many meta-analyses showed on average positive effects. Cognitive behavioral treatment programs and the risk-need-responsivity (RNR) model have the most solid evidence base but various other approaches are also promising. For sexual offenders the results are less uniform, in particular for treatment in prisons. The transfer from model projects into routine practice shows that many influences on effectiveness need to be considered, e.g. with respect to program content, context, participants, and evaluation method. The good lives model and desistance model do not need alternative paradigms but are well compatible with the extended RNR model and the what works approach.

To date, the most comprehensive typological system has been developed by Knight and Prentky (1990). These authors have developed typologies for both child molesters and rapists. The system for rapists has been replicated on at least two samples (Barbaree, Seto, Serin, Amos, &amp;amp;amp; Preston, 1994; Brown &amp; Forth, 1997); however, the child molester typology has yet to be fully replicated outside the MTC. In the present study, 109 child molesters who were assessed or treated at the Regional Treatment Centre (Ontario) were classified according to the MTC child molester typology. Interrater reliabilities were obtained for 20 participants and ranged from .90 to .40, which are comparable to those obtained in the MTC sample. Groups were compared on a number of meaningful variables, such as number of victims and sexual deviance.;,citation_author=Jan Looman;,citation_author=Claudine Gauthier;,citation_author=Douglas Boer;,citation_publication_date=2001-08;,citation_cover_date=2001-08;,citation_year=2001;,citation_issue=8;,citation_doi=10.1177/088626001016008002;,citation_issn=0886-2605, 1552-6518;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Interpersonal Violence;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=On the Effectiveness of Sexual Offender Treatment in Prisons: A Comparison of Two Different Evaluation Designs in Routine Practice;,citation_abstract=Although there is less continuity of sexual offending in the life course than stereotypes suggest, treatment should lead to a further reduction of reoffending. Contrary to this aim, a recent large British study using propensity score matching (PSM) showed some negative effects of the core sex offender treatment program (SOTP) in prisons. International meta-analyses on the effects of sex offender treatment revealed that there is considerable variety in the results, and methodological aspects and the context play a significant role. Therefore, this study compared different designs in the evaluation of sex offender treatment in German prisons. PSM was compared with an exact matching (EM) by the Static-99 in a sample of 693 sex offenders from Bavarian prisons. Most results were similar for both methods and not significant due to low base rates. There was a treatment effect at p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .05 on general recidivism in the EM and at p = .06 on serious reoffending in the PSM. For sexual recidivism, EM showed a negative trend, whereas PSM suggested the opposite. Overall, the study underlines the need for more replications of evaluations of routine practice, methodological comparisons, sensitive outcome criteria, and differentiated policy information.;,citation_author=Friedrich Lösel;,citation_author=Eva Link;,citation_author=Martin Schmucker;,citation_author=Doris Bender;,citation_author=Maike Breuer;,citation_author=Lena Carl;,citation_author=Johann Endres;,citation_author=Lora Lauchs;,citation_publication_date=2020-06;,citation_cover_date=2020-06;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1079063219871576;,citation_issn=1079-0632, 1573-286X;,citation_volume=32;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sexual Abuse;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex Offender Recidivism: Some Lessons Learned From Over 70 Years of Research;,citation_abstract=Sex offender recidivism (SOR) has been the subject of research for over 70 years. Myths, misconceptions, and erroneous conclusions about SOR, however, remain widespread, impeding the development of evidence-based policies aimed at preventing sexual offenses. To address the rich but uneven literature, a comprehensive review was conducted making it possible to provide a contextualized overview of scientific knowledge against the backdrop of methodological issues, challenges, and shortcomings. Over the years, researchers have been asked to provide a simple answer to a seemingly simple question: what are the recidivism rates for sexual offending? In response, the field has produced a wide range of findings making it difficult to draw firm conclusions, leaving room for interpretation and personal biases. The variations in recidivism rates are attributable to offender and methodological characteristics, both of which are embedded in a particular sociolegal context. As a result, the base rate of SOR is more effectively considered in terms of a series of questions that should include the type of recidivism, with whom, over what period, and in what context. Issues and debates that have marked the field and fueled its growth are highlighted.

Participants were allocated using an online randomisation tool, handled by an independent person who was separate from the staff conducting the study. Setting: General community, with recruitment nationally through mass media and advertisements. Participants: 40 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder received a BA treatment, and 41 participants received a mindfulness treatment. 9 participants were lost at the post-treatment.

Because eye-tracking is a novel methodology in sexuality research, we attempted to determine whether the eye-tracker could detect differences (should they exist) in visual attention to erotic and non-erotic scenes. A total of 20 men and 20 women were presented with a series of erotic and non-erotic images and tracked their eye movements during image presentation. Comparisons between erotic and non-erotic image groups showed significant differences on two of three dependent measures of visual attention (number of fixations and total time) in both men and women. As hypothesized, there was a significant Stimulus  Scene Region interaction, indicating that participants visually attended to the body more in the erotic stimuli than in the non-erotic stimuli, as evidenced by a greater number of fixations and longer total time devoted to that region. These findings provide support for the application of eye-tracking methodology as a measure of visual attentional capture in sexuality research.

Researchers have differed, however, on the necessity of setting some minimum criterion of penile response for ascertaining the interpretability of a phallometric test result. Proponents of a minimum criterion have generally based their view on the intuitive notion that “more is better” rather than any formal demonstration of this. The present study was conducted to investigate whether there is any empirical evidence for this intuitive notion, by examining the relation between magnitude of penile response and the agreement in diagnoses obtained in two test sessions using different laboratory stimuli. The results showed that examinees with inconsistent diagnoses responded less on both tests and that examinees with inconsistent diagnoses responded less on the second test after controlling for their response on the first test. Results also indicated that at response levels less than 1 cm3, diagnostic consistency was no better than chance, supporting the establishment of a minimum response level criterion.;,citation_author=Amy D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex Differences in Visual Attention to Erotic and Non-Erotic Stimuli;,citation_abstract=It has been suggested that sex differences in the processing of erotic material (e.g., memory, genital arousal, brain activation patterns) may also be reflected by differential attention to visual cues in erotic material. To test this hypothesis, we presented 20 heterosexual men and 20 heterosexual women with erotic and non-erotic images of heterosexual couples and tracked their eye movements during scene presentation. Results supported previous findings that erotic and non-erotic information was visually processed in a different manner by both men and women. Men looked at opposite sex figures significantly longer than did women, and women looked at same sex figures significantly longer than did men. Within-sex analyses suggested that men had a strong visual attention preference for opposite sex figures as compared to same sex figures, whereas women appeared to disperse their attention evenly between opposite and same sex figures. These differences, however, were not limited to erotic images but evidenced in non-erotic images as well. No significant sex differences were found for attention to the contextual region of the scenes. Results were interpreted as potentially supportive of recent studies showing a greater non-specificity of sexual arousal in women. This interpretation assumes there is an erotic valence to images of the sex to which one orients, even when the image is not explicitly erotic. It also assumes a relationship between visual attention and erotic valence.;,citation_author=Amy D. Lykins;,citation_author=Marta Meana;,citation_author=Gregory P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Model Building in Forensic Psychiatry: A Machine Learning Approach to Screening Offender Patients with SSD;,citation_abstract=Today’s extensive availability of medical data enables the development of predictive models, but this requires suitable statistical methods, such as machine learning (ML). Especially in forensic psychiatry, a complex and cost-intensive field with risk assessments and predictions of treatment outcomes as central tasks, there is a need for such predictive tools, for example, to anticipate complex treatment courses and to be able to offer appropriate therapy on an individualized basis. This study aimed to develop a first basic model for the anticipation of adverse treatment courses based on prior compulsory admission and/or conviction as simple and easily objectifiable parameters in offender patients with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD). With a balanced accuracy of 67% and an AUC of 0.72, gradient boosting proved to be the optimal ML algorithm. Antisocial behavior, physical violence against staff, rule breaking, hyperactivity, delusions of grandeur, fewer feelings of guilt, the need for compulsory isolation, cannabis abuse/dependence, a higher dose of antipsychotics (measured by the olanzapine half-life) and an unfavorable legal prognosis emerged as the ten most influential variables out of a dataset with 209 parameters.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Psychological and Psychosocial Interventions Offered to Forensic Mental Health Inpatients: A Systematic Review;,citation_abstract=Objective To examine the evidence for the use of psychological and psychosocial interventions offered to forensic mental health inpatients. Design CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, ScienceDirect and Web of Science databases were searched for research published in English between 1 January 1990 and 31 May 2018. Outcome measures Disturbance, mental well-being, quality of life, recovery, violence/risk, satisfaction, seclusion, symptoms, therapeutic relationship and ward environment. There were no limits on the length of follow-up. Eligibility criteria We included randomised controlled trial (RCT) studies of any psychological or psychosocial intervention in an inpatient forensic setting. Pilot or feasibility studies were included if an RCT design was used. We restricted our search criteria to inpatients in low, medium and high secure units aged over 18. We focused on interventions considered applicable to most patients residing in forensic mental health settings. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Results 17 232 citations were identified with 195 full manuscripts examined in detail. Nine papers were included in the review. The heterogeneity of the identified studies meant that meta-analysis was inappropriate. The results were presented in table form together with a narrative synthesis. Only 7 out of 91 comparisons revealed statistically significant results with no consistent significant findings. The most frequently reported outcomes were violence/risk and symptoms. 61% of the violence/risk comparisons and 79% of the symptom comparisons reported improvements in the intervention groups compared with the control groups. Conclusions Current practice is based on limited evidence with no consistent significant findings. This review suggests psychoeducational and psychosocial interventions did not reduce violence/risk, but there is tentative support they may improve symptoms. More RCTs are required with: larger sample sizes, representative populations, standardised outcomes and control group interventions similar in treatment intensity to the intervention.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Recommendations for Good Scientific Practice and the Consumers of VR-Technology;,citation_abstract=The goal of this article is to present a first list of ethical concerns that may arise from research and personal use of virtual reality (VR) and related technology, and to offer concrete recommendations for minimizing those risks. Many of the recommendations call for focused research initiatives. In the first part of the article, we discuss the relevant evidence from psychology that motivates our concerns. In Section “Plasticity in the Human Mind,” we cover some of the main results suggesting that one’s environment can influence one’s psychological states, as well as recent work on inducing illusions of embodiment. Then, in Section “Illusions of Embodiment and Their Lasting Effect,” we go on to discuss recent evidence indicating that immersion in VR can have psychological effects that last after leaving the virtual environment. In the second part of the article, we turn to the risks and recommendations. We begin, in Section “The Research Ethics of VR,” with the research ethics of VR, covering six main topics: the limits of experimental environments, informed consent, clinical risks, dual-use, online research, and a general point about the limitations of a code of conduct for research. Then, in Section “Risks for Individuals and Society,” we turn to the risks of VR for the general public, covering four main topics: long-term immersion, neglect of the social and physical environment, risky content, and privacy. We offer concrete recommendations for each of these 10 topics, summarized in Table 1.;,citation_author=Michael Madary;,citation_author=Thomas K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of Virtual Reality Training on Functional Reaching Movements in People with Parkinson’s Disease: A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial;,citation_abstract=Objective: To investigate whether practising reaching for virtual moving targets would improve motor performance in people with Parkinson’s disease. Design: Randomized pretest–posttest control group design. Setting: A virtual reality laboratory in a university setting. Participants: Thirty-three adults with Parkinson’s disease. Interventions: The virtual reality training required 60 trials of reaching for fast-moving virtual balls with the dominant hand. The control group had 60 practice trials turning pegs with their non-dominant hand. Main outcome measures: Pretest and posttest required reaching with the dominant hand to grasp real stationary balls and balls moving at different speeds down a ramp. Success rates and kinematic data (movement time, peak velocity and percentage of movement time for acceleration phase) from pretest and posttest were recorded to determine the immediate transfer effects. Results: Compared with the control group, the virtual reality training group became faster (F $\frac{1}{4}$ 9.08, P $\frac{1}{4}$ 0.005) and more forceful (F $\frac{1}{4}$ 9.36, P $\frac{1}{4}$ 0.005) when reaching for real stationary balls. However, there was no significant difference in success rate or movement kinematics between the two groups when reaching for real moving balls. Conclusion: A short virtual reality training programme improved the movement speed of discrete aiming tasks when participants reached for real stationary objects. However, the transfer effect was minimal when reaching for real moving objects.;,citation_author=Hui-Ing Ma;,citation_author=Wen-Juh Hwang;,citation_author=Jing-Jing Fang;,citation_author=Jui-Kun Kuo;,citation_author=Ching-Yi Wang;,citation_author=Iat-Fai Leong;,citation_author=Tsui-Ying Wang;,citation_publication_date=2011-10;,citation_cover_date=2011-10;,citation_year=2011;,citation_issue=10;,citation_doi=10.1177/0269215511406757;,citation_issn=0269-2155, 1477-0873;,citation_volume=25;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Clinical Rehabilitation;">

Scherer’s component process model provides predictions regarding particular face muscle deformations that are attributed as reactions to the cognitive appraisal stimuli in the study of emotion episodes. In the current work, MPEG-4 facial animation parameters are used in order to evaluate these theoretical predictions for intermediate and final expressions of a given emotion episode. We manipulate parameters such as intensity and temporal evolution of synthesized facial expressions. In emotion episodes originating from identical stimuli, by varying the cognitive appraisals of the stimuli and mapping them to different expression intensities and timings, various behavioural patterns can be generated and thus different agent character profiles can be defined. The results of the synthesis process are consequently applied to Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), aiming to render their interaction with humans, or other ECAs, more affective.;,citation_author=L Malatesta;,citation_author=A Raouzaiou;,citation_author=K Karpouzis;,citation_author=S Kollias;,citation_language=en-US;">

Mate-search primes increased attentional adhesion to physically attractive members of the opposite sex (potential mates) among participants with an unrestricted sociosexual orientation but not among sexually restricted participants (Studies 1 and 2). A mate-guarding prime increased attentional adhesion to physically attractive members of one’s own sex (potential rivals) among participants who were concerned with threats posed by intrasexual competitors but not among those less concerned about such threats (Study 3).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Intrasexual Vigilance: The Implicit Cognition of Romantic Rivalry.;,citation_abstract=Four experiments tested the hypothesis that concerns about infidelity would lead people, particularly those displaying high chronic levels of romantic jealousy, to display a functionally coordinated set of implicit cognitive biases aimed at vigilantly processing attractive romantic rivals. Priming concerns about infidelity led people with high levels of chronic jealousy (but not those low in chronic jealousy) to attend vigilantly to physically attractive same-sex targets at an early stage of visual processing (Study 1), to strongly encode and remember attractive same-sex targets (Study 2), and to form implicit negative evaluations of attractive same-sex targets (Studies 3 and 4). In each case, effects were observed only for same-sex targets who were physically attractive—individuals who can pose especially potent threats to a person’s own romantic interests. These studies reveal a cascade of implicit, lower order cognitive processes underlying romantic rivalry and identify the individuals most likely to display those processes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Approach Versus Avoidance Goals in Relapse Prevention With Sexual Offenders;,citation_abstract=Relapse prevention (RP) plays a major role in the vast number of treatment programs for sexual offenders. However, despite its widespread application, questions have been raised regarding the uncritical adoption of the approach (R. K. Hanson, 1996). More specifically, the way in which it is presented to sexual offenders has been criticized for being unhelpfully negative in focus (Mann, 2000) and it has been suggested that treatment should adopt a broader focus on improving quality of life (T. Ward and C. A. Stewart, 2003), with the expectation that recidivism would reduce as a side-effect. The current study evaluated two orientations to relapse prevention, comparing a deliberately positively-focused orientation, focusing on creating a &amp;amp;amp;quot;good life,&amp;quot; to the more traditional approach that focuses on avoiding and controlling risk factors. Twenty-four participants completed an approach-focused RP intervention and 23 completed an avoidance-focused RP intervention. Results indicated that participants who completed the approach-focused intervention had a greater engagement in treatment as measured by homework compliance and willingness to disclose lapses. Furthermore, participants within the approach-focused intervention were rated by therapist to be more genuinely motivated to live life without offending by the end of treatment. However, differences between the groups in terms of self-esteem change following treatment were not very marked.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Assessing Risk for Sexual Recidivism: Some Proposals on the Nature of Psychologically Meaningful Risk Factors;,citation_abstract=Risk assessment and treatment for sexual offenders should focus on individual characteristics associated with recidivism risk. Although it is possible to conduct risk assessments based purely on empirical correlates, the most useful evaluations also explain the source of the risk. In this review, the authors propose that the basic requirements for a psychologically meaningful risk factor are (a) a plausible rationale that the factor is a cause of sexual offending and (b) strong evidence that it predicts sexual recidivism. Based on the second of these criteria, the authors categorize potential risk factors according to the strength of the evidence for their relationship with offending. The most strongly supported variables should be emphasized in both assessment and treatment of sexual offenders. Further research is required, however, to establish causal connections between these variables and recidivism and to examine the extent to which changes in these factors leads to reductions in recidivism potential.;,citation_author=Ruth E.

Sex robots may present an opportunity for a clinical management of individuals with paraphilic interests whose realisation would result in infliction of harm and/or legal consequences. We explored the prevalence of desire for sex robot experience in a control group and two target groups: one with paraphilic interests in minors, the other with interest in O non-consent/violence. We expected both target groups to express a greater desire for sex robot experience than the control group, because sex robots would enable them to express paraphilic sexuality within legal limitations. We used data from two samples of male respondents. The control sample consisted of respondents from a representative online Czech sample (N = R 806). Target groups of individuals with paraphilic interests consisted of 48 subjects sexually interested in minors and 57 P subjects sexually interested in non-consent/violence against adults. Sex robot experience was desired by 18% of respondents in the control group, 37.5% of respondents in the group interested in minors, and 26% of respondents interested in nonconsent/violence. This indicates that individuals with paraphilic interest in minors are slightly more open to the idea of sex robot experience.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effects of a Relapse Prevention Program on Sexual Recidivism: Final Results From California’s Sex Offender Treatment and Evaluation Project (SOTEP);,citation_abstract=Final results from a longitudinal investigation of the effectiveness of cognitive- behavioral treatment with sexual offenders are presented. The study was a ran domized clinical trial that compared the reoffense rates of offenders treated in an inpatient relapse prevention (RP) program with the rates of offenders in two (untreated) prison control groups. No significant differences were found among the three groups in their rates of sexual or violent reoffending over an 8-year follow-up period. This null result was found for both rapists and child molesters, and was confirmed in analyses using time to reoffense as the outcome and those controlling for static risk differences across the groups. Closer examination of the RP group’s performance revealed that individuals who met the program’s treatment goals had lower reoffense rates than those who did not. Although our results do not generally support the efficacy of the RP model, they do suggest a number of ways in which this kind of treatment program can be improved. This study also emphasizes the importance of including appropriate control groups in treatment outcome research. Additional controlled investigations are needed to address the many questions that remain about when and how treatment works for sexual offenders.;,citation_author=Janice K.

The outcome study reported significant reductions in reoffence rates compared to a matched group of untreated sexual offenders. We show that these reductions in reoffending not only saved a significant number of people from subsequently being abused by the offenders, it also resulted in very significant savings to the taxpayers to the tune of over $14 million Canadian.

Child molesters displayed greater cognitive distortions than the other subjects and their greatest empathy deficits were toward their own victims. Consistent with the theory being examined it was found that the empathy scores of the child molesters toward their own victims were significantly correlated with the responses to the cognitive distortions scale.

We note that the literature does not always carefully distinguish Bpedophiles^ from other child molesters and that rapists are often identified as having a BNot Otherwise Specified^ paraphilia. Both these practices appear problematic. We then outline current approaches to the treatment of sex offenders which have typically been seen as relevant to dealing with all types of paraphilias. The historical emergence of sex offender treatment is noted, leading to an outline of current approaches that address known problematic issues by employing established procedures and by delivering treatment in an empirically based manner.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Offenders against Male Children: Sexual Preferences;,citation_abstract=Erectile responses among men who had sexually abused male children were compared with the responses of matched non-offenders. Stimulus presentations included nude males and females of ages ranging from 3 to 24yr, and verbal descriptions of sexual interactions involving varying levels of intrusiveness and coercive behavior between an adult male and a boy. As a group, the child molesters responsed with moderate sexual arousal (2@-40% of full erection) to the nude males of all ages. Non-offenders showed no response to the male stimuli. Surprisingly, the two groups did not differ in their response to the nude female stimuli. While the non-offenders showed no response to the verbal descriptions, the offenders showed moderate to strong arousal to the non-coercive sexual interactions, with inhibition of response to the more coercive situations. The offender group (n = 21) was subdivided into a group showing a homosexual orientation (n = 7) and a group showing a heterosexual orientation (n = 14) based on their responding to adult male and female stimuli. These two groups differed in their erectile responses in several important ways. First, in response to the nude male stimuli, the homosexual group showed strongest responding to the 15yr old with a slight drop in responding to more adult targets and a steeper sloped decrease in response to younger targets. In contrast, the heterosexual offenders, responsed maximally to the I I yr old target with a slight decrease over the younger aged-targets but a steep slope in their graded responding to older aged males. Second, in response to the verbal descriptions, the homosexual offender group showed greater levels of response to the non-coercive interactions than did the heterosexual offenders, and they showed a pattern of inhibition to the more forceful and violent coercive interactions. These findings are discussed in terms of the sexual preference hypothesis of sexual deviance, and the previous findings in this area.;,citation_author=W. L. Marshall;,citation_author=H. E.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Formal Help-Seeking among Community-Based Czech Individuals with Sexual Interest in Minors Is Associated with the Perceived Urgency of Self-Identified Concerns;,citation_abstract=Background: In the community, there are non-forensic individuals who experience sexual interest in minors and have specific mental health needs and concerns. If left unaddressed, these issues may contribute to problematic sexual behaviors. Although supportive treatment programs are emerging in Czechia, self-motivated help-seeking remains generally low in this at-risk population. Objective: To inform strategies for encouraging preventive service use, this study aimed to examine how past help-seeking experiences relate to factors that may influence the likelihood of seeking professional help, as identified in the literature. Methods: An online survey was conducted with a purposive sample of 97 community-based, predominantly male, non-forensic adults whose responses to hypothetical scenarios suggested a sexual interest in minors. The study investigated the relationship between self-reported past formal help-seeking behavior (any vs. none) and two key variables: perceived urgency of self-identified concerns and dismissive attitudes toward professional assistance. Analyses controlled for other forms of support sought. Results: Formal support sources were rarely approached. A significant association was found between low perceived urgency of self-identified concerns and the absence of formal help-seeking behavior ($\beta$ = 0.33, F(1) = 6.34, p = 0.014). Conclusion: To promote professional service uptake among this difficult-toreach population, it is essential to enhance mental health literacy across the broader community and to educate individuals about the role of psychological well-being in preventing problematic behaviors.;,citation_author=Lenka Martinec Nováková;,citation_author=Lucie Krejčová;,citation_author=Klára Bártová;,citation_author=Renáta Androvičová;,citation_author=Kateřina Klapilová;,citation_publication_date=2025-09;,citation_cover_date=2025-09;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1546102;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Virtual Reality Improves Emotional but Not Cognitive Empathy: A Meta-Analysis.;,citation_abstract=Virtual Reality (VR) has been touted as an effective empathy intervention, with its most ardent supporters claiming it is “the ultimate empathy machine.” We aimed to determine whether VR deserves this reputation, using a random-effects meta-analysis of all known studies that examined the effect of virtual reality experiences on users’ empathy (k = 43 studies, with 5,644 participants). The results indicated that many different kinds of VR experiences can increase empathy, however, there are important boundary conditions to this effect. Subgroup analyses revealed that VR improved emotional empathy, but not cognitive empathy. In other words, VR can arouse compassionate feelings but does not appear to encourage users to imagine other peoples’ perspectives. Further subgroup analyses revealed that VR was no more effective at increasing empathy than less technologically advanced empathy interventions such as reading about others and imagining their experiences. Finally, more immersive and interactive VR experiences were no more effective at arousing empathy than less expensive VR experiences such as cardboard headsets. Our results converge with existing research suggesting that different mechanisms underlie cognitive versus emotional empathy. It appears that emotional empathy can be aroused automatically when witnessing evocative stimuli in VR, but cognitive empathy may require more effortful engagement, such as using one’s own imagination to construct others’ experiences. Our results have important practical implications for nonprofits, policymakers, and practitioners who are considering using VR for prosocial purposes. In addition, we recommend that VR designers develop experiences that challenge people to engage in empathic effort.;,citation_author=Alison Jane Martingano;,citation_author=Fernanda Hererra;,citation_author=Sara Konrath;,citation_publication_date=2021-06;,citation_cover_date=2021-06;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1037/tmb0000034;,citation_issn=2689-0208;,citation_volume=2;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Technology, Mind, and Behavior;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification of Five Fundamental Implicit Theories Underlying Cognitive Distortions in Child Abusers: A Preliminary Study;,citation_abstract=Qualitative analysis of interviews with 22 child abusers found strong evidence for Ward and Keenan’s (1999) proposal that there are five implicit theories in child abusers that account for the majority of their cognitive distortions/thinking errors. These implicit theories are: Child as a sexual being where children are perceived as being able to and wanting to engage in sexual activity with adults and also are not be harmed by such sexual contact; Nature of harm where the offender perceives that sexual activity does not cause harm (and may in fact be beneficial) to the child; Entitlement where the child abuser perceives that he is superior and more important than others: and hence is able to have sex with whoever, and whenever, he wants; Dangerous world where the offender perceives that that others are abusive and rejecting and he must fight to regain control; and Uncontrollable where the offender perceives the world as uncontrollable and hence he believes that circumstances are outside of his control. There was no evidence for any other type of implicit theory. Results of the study also indicated that there was a significant difference in terms of the endorsement of the Dangerous world implicit theory between participants reporting a history of child sexual abuse and those who did not. Offenders against male victims were significantly more likely to endorse the Child as a sexual being and Dangerous world implicit theories compared to men who had offended against female children.;,citation_author=Vincent Marziano;,citation_author=Tony Ward;,citation_author=Anthony R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Executive Functioning in Pedophilia and Child Sexual Offending;,citation_abstract=Abstract Objectives: Pedophilia (P) is a psychiatric disease associated with sexual attraction toward children and often accompanied by child sexual offending (CSO). Consequently, it is important to address the understanding of executive dysfunctions that may increase the probability of CSO. Moreover, this research field has been lacking to disentangle executive deficits associated with pedophilia (as a deviant sexual preference) from those associated with CSO (as a deviant sexual behavior). Methods: The German multi-sided research network NeMUP offers the opportunity to overcome these limitations. By applying the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Battery in four carefully matched groups of men: (1) pedophiles with ( N =45) and (2) without ( N =45) a history of sexual offending against children; (3) child molesters without pedophilia ( N =19), and (4) non-offending controls ( N =49), we were able to analyze executive functioning in pedophilia and CSO independently. Results: Both CSO groups as compared to both non-CSO groups exhibited worsened response inhibition ability. However, only non-pedophilic offenders showed additionally disabled strategy use ability. Regarding set-shifting abilities, the P+CSO group showed the best performance. We also found that performances were affected by age: only in pedophiles, response inhibition worsened with age, while age-related deficits in set-shifting abilities were restricted to non-pedophilic participants. The latter also differentiated between both sexual preference groups. Conclusions: Our results are the first to demonstrate that executive dysfunctions are related to offense status rather than pedophilic preference. Furthermore, there was evidence for differentiating age and performance correlations between pedophiles and non-pedophiles, which warrants further investigation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Characteristics of First Disclosure of Child Sexual Abuse: Age, Delay, Recipient, and Feeling of Support;,citation_abstract=Background Little population-based evidence exists about the characteristics of first disclosure of child sexual abuse (CSA), including age and delay. Objective To generate population-based evidence about the age of first disclosure, delay to first disclosure, first recipients, and feelings of support. Participants and setting The Australian Child Maltreatment Study collected information about CSA victimization from a nationally representative sample of 8503 individuals aged 16 and over. CSA prevalence was 28.5&nbsp;%. Almost one half of these individuals (45.2&nbsp;%) had never disclosed their experience of CSA before participating in the survey. Slightly over one half (54.8&nbsp;%) of these individuals had disclosed before participating, and provided information about the characteristics of their first disclosure. Methods We generated national estimates for age of first disclosure, delay to first disclosure, first recipients, and feeling supported, and compared results by gender and age group. Results Among individuals who disclosed, 70.2&nbsp;% first disclosed before age 18, comprising more women (73.7&nbsp;%) than men (60.4&nbsp;%); and with participants aged 16–24 more likely (81.2&nbsp;%) than people aged 25–44 (67.8&nbsp;%) and 45 or more (68.7&nbsp;%). Among individuals who disclosed, almost half (45.6&nbsp;%) first disclosed within a year; the median delay was 1&nbsp;year and the mean delay was 7.1&nbsp;years. One in 10 people aged 25 or more (11.1&nbsp;%) delayed more than 20&nbsp;years. First recipients were typically mothers (30.9&nbsp;%) and friends (24.9&nbsp;%). Most people felt supported (79.8&nbsp;%), especially those aged 16–24 (87.3&nbsp;%). Conclusions We identified significant trends in CSA disclosure characteristics. Many people first disclose in childhood, often within a year. Yet, many only disclose in adulthood, after a long delay. While disclosure is becoming more common, measures are required to facilitate disclosure and supportive responses.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Toward Brain Correlates of Natural Behavior: fMRI during Violent Video Games;,citation_abstract=Modern video games represent highly advanced virtual reality simulations and often contain virtual violence. In a significant amount of young males, playing video games is a quotidian activity, making it an almost natural behavior. Recordings of brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during gameplay may reflect neuronal correlates of real-life behavior. We recorded 13 experienced gamers (18 –26 years; average 14 hrs/week playing) while playing a violent first-person shooter game (a violent computer game played in self-perspective) by means of distortion and dephasing reduced fMRI (3 T; single-shot triple-echo echo-planar imaging [EPI]). Content analysis of the video and sound with 100 ms time resolution achieved relevant behavioral variables. These variables explained significant signal variance across large distributed networks. Occurrence of violent scenes revealed significant neuronal correlates in an event-related design. Activation of dorsal and deactivation of rostral anterior cingulate and amygdala characterized the mid-frontal pattern related to virtual violence. Statistics and effect sizes can be considered large at these areas. Optimized imaging strategies allowed for single-subject and for single-trial analysis with good image quality at basal brain structures. We propose that virtual environments can be used to study neuronal processes involved in semi-naturalistic behavior as determined by content analysis. Importantly, the activation pattern reflects brain-environment interactions rather than stimulus responses as observed in classical experimental designs. We relate our findings to the general discussion on social effects of playing first-person shooter games.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Male Body Movements as Possible Cues to Physical Strength: A Biomechanical Analysis: Male Movements as Cues to Strength;,citation_abstract=Objectives: Comparative research suggests that male courtship displays signal condition-dependent traits to females; these displays might also provide cues to potential male competitors. Although some associations between human movements and physical/behavioral qualities have been found, such research has typically only been conducted from a perspective of female mate choice. Here, using advanced motion capture and biomechanical analyses, we examine the extent to which male dancing provides cues about the dancer’s physical qualities to both males and females. Methods: Thirty men aged 19–37 were recorded using motion-capture technology as they danced to a standard rhythm. Participants also completed a vascular fitness test, assessments of upper- and lower-body strength, and biomechanical indices were extracted from their dance movements. Dance clips were converted into virtual humanoid characters (avatars) and rated by 27 women and 21 men on perceived dance quality. Results: General linear mixed modeling revealed that both handgrip strength and arm movements of the dancer were statistically significant predictors of dance quality ratings; stronger males who displayed larger, more variable, and faster movements of their arms being rated as better dancers. There was no effect of the sex of the observer in predicting dance quality ratings, indicating that male and female observers rated dance quality equivalently. Physical fitness was not associated with perceived dance quality. Conclusions: Men and women are able to derive certain quality cues from observing male dance movements in the form of controlled stimuli. Thus, male dancing may form a condition-dependent ornament of certain aspects of mate quality. Am. J. Hum. Biol. 25:307–312, 2013.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Sense of Self: The Role of Presence in Virtual Environments;,citation_abstract=Several factors contribute to an individual’s experiences in computer-based environments. Previous research shows one such factor, the degree to which users feel connected to a virtual environment, influences the actions of individuals within the environment (Banos et al., 2008; Welch, 1999). Additional factors, such as people’s personality and the personality of their avatar, influence behaviors in virtual environments (McCreery, Krach, Schrader, &amp;amp;amp; Boone, 2012). The current study focused on the role of presence as it affects behavior within the virtual environment. Presence has been defined as the psychological state where virtual experiences feel authentic. However, the degree to which presence acts as a mediating variable in virtual environments is not well understood. The current study employed a combination of survey instruments and direct observation to explore the relationships among personality of self and avatar, presence, and behaviors within a virtual environment. Findings indicated that participant scores in the domain of agreeableness were a significant predictor of agreeable behavior in the virtual environment. However, with the exception of negative effects (e.g., dizziness), presence does not appear to influence behavior. Overall implications for these findings are discussed.;,citation_author=Michael P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Review of Effective Interventions for Reducing Aggression and Violence;,citation_abstract=This paper addresses the question of whether individual violence can be reduced in frequency or severity, if so to what extent and by which methods. It opens with a brief overview of the nature of personal violence and discussion of some key definitional and methodological problems. However, its principal focus is on the findings obtained from a series of meta-analytic reviews of structured programmes for adolescents and adults who have shown repeated aggression or been convicted of personal violence, drawing together the results of studies conducted in prison, probation, youth justice and allied services. Additional results are considered from a systematic review of studies of violence prevention among offenders with mental disorders. This incorporates the preliminary findings of a meta-analysis of controlled trials of psychosocial interventions with that population. Overall, it is concluded that there is sufficient evidence currently available to substantiate the claim that personal violence can be reduced by psychosocial interventions, but that much more research is required to delineate the parameters of effectiveness in this context.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Evaluating Display Fidelity and Interaction Fidelity in a Virtual Reality Game;,citation_abstract=In recent years, consumers have witnessed a technological revolution that has delivered more-realistic experiences in their own homes through high-definition, stereoscopic televisions and natural, gesture-based video game consoles. Although these experiences are more realistic, offering higher levels of fidelity, it is not clear how the increased display and interaction aspects of fidelity impact the user experience. Since immersive virtual reality (VR) allows us to achieve very high levels of fidelity, we designed and conducted a study that used a six-sided CAVE to evaluate display fidelity and interaction fidelity independently, at extremely high and low levels, for a VR first-person shooter (FPS) game. Our goal was to gain a better understanding of the effects of fidelity on the user in a complex, performance-intensive context. The results of our study indicate that both display and interaction fidelity significantly affect strategy and performance, as well as subjective judgments of presence, engagement, and usability. In particular, performance results were strongly in favor of two conditions: low-display, low-interaction fidelity (representative of traditional FPS games) and high-display, high-interaction fidelity (similar to the real world).;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Convergent and Predictive Associations of Three Measures of Pedophilic Interest;,citation_abstract=Pedophilic interest is a central risk factor for sexual offending against children. Multiple measures exist to assess pedophilic interest, and the present study aims to provide validity evidence for three of these measures in a sample of men convicted of sexual offenses. The association between a phallometric test for pedophilic interest, the Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interest (SSPI), and the sexual deviance factor of the Violence Risk Scale–Sexual Offense (VRS-SO) version was examined in a sample of 261 men who participated in sexual violence reduction services. The association between these measures and sexual recidivism, both as sole predictors and while controlling for static risk, was also assessed. The second aim of the study was to examine the validity of different methods for modeling the distribution of pedophilic interests, using phallometric test scores, based on the findings in recent taxometric research. The measures generally showed a positive and moderate relationship with each other and predicted sexual recidivism. However, the SSPI did not significantly predict sexual recidivism, and when controlling for static risk, only the VRS-SO Sexual Deviance factor significantly predicted this outcome. Modeling phallometric test scores continuously and trichotomously produced significant associations with sexual recidivism; however, only a trichotomous model with two levels remained predictive after controlling for static risk. The results are broadly supportive of measures of pedophilic interest and underscore the importance of appropriately modeling the latent structure of pedophilic interest.;,citation_author=Ian V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Interventions for Pedohebephilic Arousal in Men Convicted for Sexual Offenses Against Children: A Meta-Analytic Review;,citation_abstract=Pedohebephilic interest is posited to be a key factor in why some individuals pursue sexual contact with children. Given the centrality of pedohebephilic interest, several interventions have been developed to help men manage or inhibit their sexual arousal to children (e.g., behavioral interventions) or to reduce the intensity of their experience of such arousal (e.g., psychopharmacological interventions). A meta-analytic review was conducted to examine the effectiveness of interventions for managing pedohebephilic arousal, as measured by phallometric testing, in men convicted of sexual offenses against children. A systematic literature review identified 23 within-group design studies and 18 single case design studies, including 1,071 men, to be included in the meta-analysis. Behavioral and pharmacological interventions showed moderate to large effects for reducing pedohebephilic arousal. In addition, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing showed some promise across two studies. Moderator analyses suggest that men with high pretreatment pedohebephilic arousal showed the greatest reductions in arousal. Small effects were found for comprehensive treatment programs, while none of the interventions had the effect of increasing sexual arousal to adults. These meta-analytic results support the effects of behavioral and pharmacological interventions for managing pedohebephilic arousal in men convicted of sexual offenses against children.;,citation_author=Ian V.

Understanding latent structure has wide-ranging implications for measurement practices, statistical modelling choices, clinical/applied practice, and research examining etiology and causation. Most constructs in psychological science tend towards dimensional latent structure and can be accurately characterised as continua. One exception to this general rule is human sexual attraction. Within this area of psychological science, the status of sexual preference for children over adults is contested, with different studies suggesting varying latent structures. Using a large sample of males living in the community (N = 8,776), the current research aims to provide a robust evaluation of the latent structure of sexual maturity interests.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Validity in Phallometric Testing for Sexual Interests in Children: A Meta-Analytic Review;,citation_abstract=Valid assessment of pedohebephilic interests (i.e., sexual interest in children) is fundamental to forensic clinical practice. Phallometric testing—which measures changes in penile circumference or volume while stimuli depicting different ages and sexual activities are presented—is widely used in clinical and research settings to detect such interests. This metaanalysis summarizes studies comparing sexual offenders against children and various types of controls on phallometric tests for pedohebephilic interests (37 samples; N = 6,785) and studies examining the relationship between phallometric test scores and sexual re-offending (16 samples; N = 2,709). The findings suggest that several phallometric testing procedures are valid indicators of pedohebephilic interest. Certain methodological features of phallometric tests were associated with greater validity, such as slide or audio-plus-slide stimuli and z-score based indices. In addition, phallometric tests for pedohebephilic, pedophilic, and hebephilic interests predicted sexual re-offending which provides further evidence that phallometric test scores are valid indicators of sexual interest in children. In general, the interpretation of phallometric test scores as indicators of pedohebephilic interests is supported.;,citation_author=Ian V. McPhail;,citation_author=Chantal A.

Child molestation or other pedophilic behavior may result as a consequence of a brain disorder. Aim. To characterize the mechanisms of pedophilic behavior associated with neurological diseases. Methods. We report eight patients with pedophilic behavior as a manifestation of their brain disorder and review the literature. Main Outcome Measures. The sexual, neuropsychiatric, and neurological aspects of a series of patients. Results. All eight developed sexual behavior toward prepubescent children in mid- to late-life coincident with the development of a neurological disorder. Five had limited insight, anxiety, or concern for their behavior and tended to have frontal lobe executive deficits. Most of this group had frontally predominant disorders. Two others retained insight and concern in the context of marked hypersexuality. This second group had treated Parkinson’s disease and resembled reports of pedophilic behavior from subcortical lesions. The further presence of right temporal lobeamygdala involvement may have predisposed to specific sexual preoccupation in some patients. Conclusions. Brain disorders may release a predisposition to sexual attraction for children through disinhibition with frontal disease, sexual preoccupation with right temporal disease, or hypersexuality with subcortical disease in non-motor basal ganglia, hypothalamus, or septal nuclei. Differentiating these mechanisms of pedophilic behavior from brain disease could facilitate targeted interventions. Mendez M and Shapira JS. Pedophilic behavior from brain disease.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Using Physiological Biomarkers in Forensic Psychiatry: A Scoping Review;,citation_abstract=Forensic psychiatry aims to reduce criminogenic risks and enhance societal safety. While effective at a macro level, crime recidivism rates among forensic patients remain substantial. This underlines the need for innovation, with growing interest in the use of physiological biomarkers. To identify the extent (size), range, (variety), and nature (characteristics) of evidence on the use of physiological biomarkers in forensic psychiatry, a systematic scoping review was conducted following JBI methodology and PRISMA-ScR guidance. Data on study characteristics and results were extracted by two independent reviewers from 431 primary research studies published in scientific journals and dissertations. Most studies were conducted in North America (53.4%) and Europe (41.3%). The majority employed an observational design (95.6%) and were cross-sectional (87.7%). Studies predominantly focused on males (84.9%) and adults (85.9%). The most common diagnoses were psychopathy/antisocial personality disorder (51.7%) and sexual disorders (21.8%). Brain activity served as a biomarker outcome in 51.3% of studies, followed by peripheral sympathetic arousal (29.2%) and peripheral sexual arousal (13.8%). Biomarker assessment methods reflected these findings. Etiologic biomarker functions were most common (77.2%), followed by diagnostic functions (12.7%). Findings reveal several gaps in the existing scientific literature. Specifically, more experimental and longitudinal research is needed to integrate physiological biomarkers into e.g., interventions, effect monitoring, and (risk) assessment. Also, a greater focus on juveniles, patients with psychotic and substance use disorders, and the use of newer biomarker assessment methods measuring peripheral arousal is essential to advance the field.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sekundärprävention der Nutzung von Kindesmissbrauchsabbildungen im Internet: ein internationaler Überblicksversuch;,citation_abstract=Prevention of the consumption of online child sexual exploitation material presents society with a host of new challenges and is a priority of the European Union (EU). Alongside the identification and prosecution of individuals who use child sexual exploitation material, there is a strong desire to prevent these offences before they occur. Due to the reports of exponential rises in detected child sexual exploitation material offending behaviour, an enhanced focus has been on secondary prevention efforts. Based on prevention and intervention models, this article briefly reviews some of the secondary prevention deterrence and psychosocial intervention efforts in Europe, with the aim to inform and support professionals in research, politics and service provision in German-speaking countries who wish to develop such approaches. The article initially discusses the European Commission’s current classification criteria to better understand and classify child sexual abuse and exploitation prevention programs. Approaches to preventative deterrence by law enforcement agencies are addressed, alongside the importance of cross-sectional collaboration with various stakeholders such as technology companies (e.g., Microsoft) and nongovernmental organisations (e.g., the International Hotline Operators of Europe). This is particularly focused on the situational prevention efforts and deterrence of at-risk populations. Furthermore, psychosocial intervention providers, such as the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, Stop it Now! Helpline, Project PARAPHILE, Kein Täter werden and other secondary prevention services in Germany, show the growth and diversity of work by existing prevention providers.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Why Humans Have Sex;,citation_abstract=Historically, the reasons people have sex have been assumed to be few in number and simple in nature–to reproduce, to experience pleasure, or to relieve sexual tension. Several theoretical perspectives suggest that motives for engaging in sexual intercourse may be larger in number and psychologically complex in nature. Study 1 used a nomination procedure that identified 237 expressed reasons for having sex, ranging from the mundane (e.g., “I wanted to experience physical pleasure”) to the spiritual (e.g., “I wanted to get closer to God”), from altruistic (e.g., “I wanted the person to feel good about himself/herself”) to vengeful (e.g., “I wanted to get back at my partner for having cheated on me”). Study 2 asked participants (N = 1,549) to evaluate the degree to which each of the 237 reasons had led them to have sexual intercourse. Factor analyses yielded four large factors and 13 subfactors, producing a hierarchical taxonomy. The Physical reasons subfactors included Stress Reduction, Pleasure, Physical Desirability, and Experience Seeking. The Goal Attainment subfactors included Resources, Social Status, Revenge, and Utilitarian. The Emotional subfactors included Love and Commitment and Expression. The three Insecurity subfactors included Self-Esteem Boost, Duty/Pressure, and Mate Guarding. Significant gender differences supported several previously advanced theories. Individual differences in expressed reasons for having sex were coherently linked with personality traits and with individual differences in sexual strategies.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Violent Aggression Predicted by Multiple Pre-Adult Environmental Hits;,citation_abstract=Early exposure to negative environmental impact shapes individual behavior and potentially contributes to any mental disease. We reported previously that accumulated environmental risk markedly decreases age at schizophrenia onset. Follow-up of matched extreme group individuals ($\leq$1 vs. $\geq$3 risks) unexpectedly revealed that high-risk subjects had $&amp;amp;amp;gt;$5 times greater probability of forensic hospitalization. In line with longstanding sociological theories, we hypothesized that risk accumulation before adulthood induces violent aggression and criminal conduct, independent of mental illness. We determined in 6 independent cohorts (4 schizophrenia and 2 general population samples) pre-adult risk exposure, comprising urbanicity, migration, physical and sexual abuse as primary, and cannabis or alcohol as secondary hits. All single hits by themselves were marginally associated with higher violent aggression. Most strikingly, however, their accumulation strongly predicted violent aggression (odds ratio 10.5). An epigenome-wide association scan to detect differential methylation of blood-derived DNA of selected extreme group individuals yielded overall negative results. Conversely, determination in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of histone-deacetylase1 mRNA as “umbrella mediator” of epigenetic processes revealed an increase in the high-risk group, suggesting lasting epigenetic alterations. Together, we provide sound evidence of a disease-independent unfortunate relationship between well-defined pre-adult environmental hits and violent aggression, calling for more efficient prevention.;,citation_author=Marina Mitjans;,citation_author=Jan Seidel;,citation_author=Martin Begemann;,citation_author=Fabian Bockhop;,citation_author=Jorge Moya-Higueras;,citation_author=Vikas Bansal;,citation_author=Janina Wesolowski;,citation_author=Anna Seelbach;,citation_author=Manuel Ignacio Ibáñez;,citation_author=Fatka Kovacevic;,citation_author=Oguzhan Duvar;,citation_author=Lourdes Fañanás;,citation_author=Hannah-Ulrike Wolf;,citation_author=Generós Ortet;,citation_author=Peter Zwanzger;,citation_author=Verena Klein;,citation_author=Ina Lange;,citation_author=Andreas Tänzer;,citation_author=Manuela Dudeck;,citation_author=Lars Penke;,citation_author=Ludger Tebartz Elst;,citation_author=Robert A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The “Dunkelfeld“ Project for Self-Identified Pedophiles: A Reappraisal of Its Effectiveness;,citation_abstract=Introduction: The “Dunkelfeld” project offers pharmacologic treatment and psychotherapy to self-referred pedophilic patients in an anonymous way. Aim: To provide a re-assessment focusing on the crucial time Â group interaction (ie, the treatment effect). Methods: A recent study reported on the effectiveness of the “Dunkelfeld” program based on intermediate data of a treatment group (TG; n $\frac{1}{4}$ 53) and a waiting-list control group (CG; n $\frac{1}{4}$ 22). With psychological indicators, it was concluded that the therapy program changed dynamic risk factors that are associated with sexually offending against children. Although based on an independent groups pre-post design, the original report includes within-group pre- and post-comparisons only, as well as between-group comparisons at the pre- and posttreatment stages. In the current study, an effect size index was computed that compares the change occurring in both groups (TG and CG) with each other (Morris d). Moreover, 95% CI of d were calculated. Main Outcome Measures: The analyses were limited to 12 dynamic risk factors pertaining to emotional dysfunction, offense-supportive attitudes, sexual dysregulation, impression management, and 2 types of delinquent behavior, including recent behavior related to sexual offenses against children and recent use of child sexual abuse images. Results: All 14 indicators showed weak treatment effects at most, with a median d of 0.30. None of the effect sizes was statistically significant (ie, in every case the 95% CI included 0). Further methodologic concerns include a familywise error rate close to 1 and too little statistical power to identify potential effects. Clinical Implications: As far as dynamic risk factors are concerned, the data do not show that treatment within the “Dunkelfeld” program leads to any reduction of the proneness to commit sexual offenses against children. Strengths &amp;amp;amp; Limitations: The current study adds crucial information lacking in the original analysis. Because the re-appraisal has the same limited statistical power as the original study, the current results are tentative in the sense that the possibility of the program being effective cannot be ruled out. A further limitation is that not all of the dynamic risk factors chosen as indicators of possible treatment success have been established as relevant for sexual (re-)offending in prior empirical studies. Conclusions: The outcome emphasizes the notion that independent groups pretest-posttest designs should be analyzed based on the treatment Â time interaction. Mokros A, Banse R.

We emphasize the importance of deliberate leadership and describe five general strategies that lead authors can employ to maximize opportunities and navigate challenges: care in recruiting the author team, care in crediting the author team, clear and frequent communication, organized materials, and deliberate and early decision-making. For each, we offer specific tips in line with these strategies (e.g., use collaboration agreements, leverage Open Science practices). We then suggest how lead authors can structure the writing and revising process to produce a coherent manuscript and offer tips for submitting papers and responding to peer-reviews. A repository of resources for people writing manuscripts in collaborations is available at osf.io/dzwcn.;,citation_author=Hannah Moshontz;,citation_author=Charles R. Ebersole;,citation_author=Sara J.

By the special dominance of the certification in the field of penal law assessment, this proved to be problematic for many predominantly non-penal experts. This led to a requirement to develop a qualification for the non-penal expert opinions. In particular the increasing specialization of the psychiatric disciplines and the diversity of the legal issues and framework require a continuing education in the field of non-penal psychiatric assessments. Substantive and formal requirements are discussed and a continuous process of quality improvement and assurance is outlined.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Changes in Sexual Arousal as Measured by Penile Plethysmography in Men with Pedophilic Sexual Interest;,citation_abstract=Introduction. Although pedophilia is defined by a recurrent sexual interest in prepubescent children, little attention has been paid to the stability or fluidity of this sexual interest over time. Aim. The aim of the current study was to investigate if patterns of penile tumescence (as a proxy for sexual interest) measured by penile plethysmography testing (PPT) can change. Methods. In this retrospective chart review study, PPT results of 43 men diagnosed with pedophilia were collected and analyzed. All participants displayed a pedophilic sexual arousal pattern at the time of their first PPT. To test for change, we compared initial PPT results with subsequent PPT results measured at least 6 months later. Main Outcome Measure. Sexual arousal was assessed using PPT by measuring change in penile circumference induced by the presentation of standardized sexual audio stimuli. Results. Approximately half of the sample (n = 21) displayed a change in PPT results. This change was characterized by a significant decrease of sexual arousal in response to pedophilic (child) stimuli and a significant increase of sexual arousal in response to nonpedophilic (adult) stimuli. No differences between sexual interest changers (ICs) and nonchangers (NC) were found for demographic data or for length of time between assessments. However, betweengroup comparisons revealed that ICs had significantly lower pedophilic indices at the initial assessment than NCs. Conclusions. Results from the current study indicate that relative pedophilic interest, as defined by increase in penile circumference in response to nonpedophilic stimuli as measured by PPT, changed in about 50% of men diagnosed with pedophilia who also had initial pedophilic PPT sexual responses. This represents a significant challenge to the hypothesis that sexual interest in men with pedophilia is unchangeable and should be the focus of future studies.

Evidence from Voxel-Based Morphometry;,citation_abstract=“Psychopathy” according to the PCL-R describes a specific subgroup of antisocial personality disorder with a high risk for criminal relapses. Lesion and imaging studies point towards frontal or temporal brain regions connected with disturbed social behavior, antisocial personality disorder (APD) and psychopathy. Morphologically, some studies described a reduced prefrontal brain volume, whereas others reported on temporal lobe atrophy. To further investigate whether participants with psychopathy according to the Psychopathy Checklist — Revised Version (PCL-R) show abnormalities in brain structure, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to investigate region-specific changes in gray matter in 17 forensic male inpatients with high PCL-R scores (PCL-R$&amp;amp;amp;gt;$28) and 17 male control subjects with low PCL-R scores (PCL$&amp;lt;$10). We found significant gray matter reductions in frontal and temporal brain regions in psychopaths compared with controls. In particular, we found a highly significant volume loss in the right superior temporal gyrus. This is the first study to show that psychopathy is associated with a decrease in gray matter in both frontal and temporal brain regions, in particular in the right superior temporal gyrus, supporting the hypothesis that a disturbed frontotemporal network is critically involved in the pathogenesis of psychopathy.;,citation_author=Jürgen L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Characteristics That Predict Exposure to and Subsequent Intentional Viewing of Child Sexual Abuse Material among a Community Sample of Internet Users;,citation_abstract=Background: An important element of reducing the sexual abuse and exploitation of children is to understand the behaviors of individuals who consume child sexual abuse material (CSAM), including the predictors of continued use. Objective: To investigate predictors of “ever viewing” CSAM and subsequent intentional use among individuals in the community. Method: This study used multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify significant predictors of ever viewing CSAM (n = 742) in an anonymous survey of 5512 Internet users in the community, and of subsequent intentional CSAM use among a subset of 459 CSAM viewers. Results: The characteristics of respondents that were significantly associated with ever viewing CSAM were being male, older in age (25–34 and 55+ years cf. 18–24 years), residing in Australia, New Zealand, or Canada (cf. the United Kingdom), earlier exposure to adult pornography ($&amp;amp;amp;lt;$14 years), experiencing childhood physical abuse or neglect, viewing bestiality pornography featuring adults, viewing bondage/S&amp;M (BDSM) pornography featuring adults, being likely (selfreported) to have sexual contact with a child, and visiting pedophilic chat forums online. In the subset sample, almost half (218, 47.5 %) viewed CSAM again intentionally after first exposure. Predictors of subsequent intentional viewing of CSAM after adjusting for age and country of residence were being male, ever experiencing loneliness, searching for CSAM intentionally at first exposure, being likely (self-reported) to have sexual contact with a child, and visiting pedophilic chat forums online. Conclusions: The findings have strong implications for prevention of first exposure to CSAM, and of continued CSAM use after exposure does occur.;,citation_author=Sarah Skye Napier;,citation_author=Michael C.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Structure of Common Emotion Regulation Strategies: A Meta-Analytic Examination.;,citation_abstract=Emotion regulation has been examined extensively with regard to important outcomes, including psychological and physical health. However, the literature includes many different emotion regulation strategies but little examination of how they relate to one another, making it difficult to interpret and synthesize findings. The goal of this meta-analysis was to examine the underlying structure of common emotion regulation strategies (i.e., acceptance, behavioral avoidance, distraction, experiential avoidance, expressive suppression, mindfulness, problem solving, reappraisal, rumination, worry), and to evaluate this structure in light of theoretical models of emotion regulation. We also examined how distress tolerance—an important emotion regulation ability — relates to strategy use. We conducted metaanalyses estimating the correlations between emotion regulation strategies (based on 331 samples and 670 effect sizes), as well as between distress tolerance and strategies. The resulting meta-analytic correlation matrix was submitted to confirmatory and exploratory factor analyses. None of the confirmatory models, based on prior theory, was an acceptable fit to the data. Exploratory factor analysis suggested that 3 underlying factors best characterized these data. Two factors— labeled Disengagement and Aversive Cognitive Perseveration— emerged as strongly correlated but distinct factors, with the latter consisting of putatively maladaptive strategies. The third factor, Adaptive Engagement, was a less unified factor and weakly related to the other 2 factors. Distress tolerance was most closely associated with low levels of repetitive negative thought and experiential avoidance, and high levels of acceptance and mindfulness. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings and applications to emotion regulation assessment.;,citation_author=Kristin Naragon-Gainey;,citation_author=Tierney P.

This paper explores the impact of The Lucy Faithfull Foundation’s “Stop It Now!” campaign in the UK (2015–2018) on help-seeking. Helpline calls (11,190 unique callers), website analytics (109,432 new website visitors) and three website-hosted surveys (N = 252) provided data on help-seeking, awareness, and self-reported behavior. Results indicated that there were more visitors to the help website during active campaigning periods, and helpline callers and website visitors were more likely to seek help after viewing campaign materials during active than non-active campaign periods. Helpseekers were predominantly men concerned about their own behavior. Survey 2 respondents concerned about their own behavior (n = 53) indicated that their awareness of the law (75.5%), and legal and personal consequences (67.9%) had changed after hearing about the campaign, and 66% reported a change in behavior.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An Embodied Perspective as a Victim of Sexual Harassment in Virtual Reality Reduces Action Conformity in a Later Milgram Obedience Scenario;,citation_abstract=Abstract Group pressure can often result in people carrying out harmful actions towards others that they would not normally carry out by themselves. However, few studies have manipulated factors that might overcome this. Here male participants (n = 60) were in a virtual reality (VR) scenario of sexual harassment (SH) of a lone woman by a group of males in a bar. Participants were either only embodied as one of the males (Group, n = 20), or also as the woman (Woman, n = 20). A control group (n = 20) only experienced the empty bar, not the SH. One week later they were the Teacher in a VR version of Milgram’s Obedience experiment where they were encouraged to give shocks to a female Learner by a group of 3 virtual males. Those who had been in the Woman condition gave about half the number of shocks of those in the Group condition, with the controls between these two. We explain the results through embodiment promoting identification with the woman or the group, and delegitimization of the group for those in the Woman condition. The experiment raised important ethical issues, showing that a VR study with positive ethical intentions can sometimes produce unexpected and non-beneficent results.;,citation_author=Solène Neyret;,citation_author=Xavi Navarro;,citation_author=Alejandro Beacco;,citation_author=Ramon Oliva;,citation_author=Pierre Bourdin;,citation_author=Jose Valenzuela;,citation_author=Itxaso Barberia;,citation_author=Mel Slater;,citation_publication_date=2020-12;,citation_cover_date=2020-12;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1038/s41598-020-62932-w;,citation_issn=2045-2322;,citation_volume=10;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Scientific Reports;">

This study addresses this gap with an in-depth content analysis of the case files of ten convicted child sexual offenders (CSOs) with the longest detection lag, selected from a broader group (n = 349) of men incarcerated at the Massachusetts Treatment Center (MTC). Participants were examined on a range of offender characteristics including Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), cognitive distortions, antisocial traits, indicators of pedophilia and Machiavellian or narcissistic traits, offense facilitating factors, and grooming behavior. A tentative profile emerged with the following characteristics: direct experience of childhood abuse, various cognitive distortions, specialized rather than versatile criminal history, pedophilic traits, Machiavellian traits, and engaging in a range of offense-facilitating behaviors including grooming. We provide insight into offenders who evade detection for CSA and set the foundation for further research to inform prevention strategies for law enforcement agencies and child-serving organizations.;,citation_author=Samuel J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=IDGenerator: Unique Identifier Generator for Epidemiologic or Clinical Studies;,citation_abstract=Background: Creating study identifiers and assigning them to study participants is an important feature in epidemiologic studies, ensuring the consistency and privacy of the study data. The numbering system for identifiers needs to be random within certain number constraints, to carry extensions coding for organizational information, or to contain multiple layers of numbers per participant to diversify data access. Available software can generate globally-unique identifiers, but identifier-creating tools meeting the special needs of epidemiological studies are lacking. We have thus set out to develop a software program to generate IDs for epidemiological or clinical studies. Results: Our software IDGenerator creates unique identifiers that not only carry a random identifier for a study participant, but also support the creation of structured IDs, where organizational information is coded into the ID directly. This may include study center (for multicenter-studies), study track (for studies with diversified study programs), or study visit (baseline, follow-up, regularly repeated visits). Our software can be used to add a check digit to the ID to minimize data entry errors. It facilitates the generation of IDs in batches and the creation of layered IDs (personal data ID, study data ID, temporary ID, external data ID) to ensure a high standard of data privacy. The software is supported by a user-friendly graphic interface that enables the generation of IDs in both standard text and barcode 128B format. Conclusion: Our software IDGenerator can create identifiers meeting the specific needs for epidemiologic or clinical studies to facilitate study organization and data privacy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=QuickVR: A Standard Library for Virtual Embodiment in Unity;,citation_abstract=In the last few years the field of Virtual Reality (VR) has experienced significant growth through the introduction of low-cost VR devices to the mass market. However, VR has been used for many years by researchers since it has proven to be a powerful tool across a vast array of research fields and applications. The key aspect of any VR experience is that it is completely immersive, which means that the virtual world totally surrounds the participant. Some game engines such as Unity already support VR out of the box and an application can be configured for VR in a matter of minutes. However, there is still the lack of a standard and easy to use tool in order to embody participants into a virtual human character that responds synchronously to their movements with corresponding virtual body movements. In this paper we introduce QuickVR, a library based on Unity which not only offers embodiment in a virtual character, but also provides a series of high level features that are necessary in any VR application, helping to dramatically reduce the production time.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=AI-powered Standardised Patients: Evaluating ChatGPT-4o’s Impact on Clinical Case Management in Intern Physicians;,citation_abstract=Background Artificial Intelligence is currently being applied in healthcare for diagnosis, decision-making and education. ChatGPT-4o, with its advanced language and problem-solving capabilities, offers an innovative alternative as a virtual standardised patient in clinical training. Intern physicians are expected to develop clinical case management skills such as problem-solving, clinical reasoning and crisis management. In this study, ChatGPT4o’s served as virtual standardised patient and medical interns as physicians on clinical case management. This study aimed to evaluate intern physicians’ competencies in clinical case management; problem-solving, clinical reasoning, crisis management and explore the impact and potential of ChatGPT-4o as a viable tool for assessing these competencies. Methods This study used a simultaneous triangulation design, integrating quantitative and qualitative data. Conducted at Aydın Adnan Menderes University, with 21 sixth-year medical students, ChatGPT-4o simulated realistic patient interactions requiring competencies in clinical case management; problem-solving, clinical reasoning, crisis management. Data were gathered through self-assessment survey, semi-structured interviews, observations of the students and ChatGPT-4o during the process. Analyses included Pearson correlation, Chi-square, and Kruskal-Wallis tests, with content analysis conducted on qualitative data using MAXQDA software for coding. Results According to the findings, observation and self-assessment survey scores of intern physicians’ clinical case management skills were positively correlated. There was a significant gap between participants’ self-assessment and actual performance, indicating discrepancies in self-perceived versus real clinical competence. Participants reported feeling inadequate in their problem-solving and clinical reasoning competencies and experienced time pressure. They were satisfied with the Artificial Intelligence-powered standardised patient process and were willing to continue similar practices. Participants engaged with a uniform patient experience. Although participants were satisfied, the application process was sometimes negatively affected due to disconnection problems and language processing challenges.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Estimating the Reproducibility of Psychological Science;,citation_abstract=Empirically analyzing empirical evidence One of the central goals in any scientific endeavor is to understand causality. Experiments that seek to demonstrate a cause/effect relation most often manipulate the postulated causal factor. Aarts et al. describe the replication of 100 experiments reported in papers published in 2008 in three high-ranking psychology journals. Assessing whether the replication and the original experiment yielded the same result according to several criteria, they find that about one-third to one-half of the original findings were also observed in the replication study. Science , this issue 10.1126/science.aac4716 , A large-scale assessment suggests that experimental reproducibility in psychology leaves a lot to be desired. , INTRODUCTION Reproducibility is a defining feature of science, but the extent to which it characterizes current research is unknown. Scientific claims should not gain credence because of the status or authority of their originator but by the replicability of their supporting evidence. Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. RATIONALE There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Potentially problematic practices include selective reporting, selective analysis, and insufficient specification of the conditions necessary or sufficient to obtain the results. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding and is the means of establishing reproducibility of a finding with new data. We conducted a large-scale, collaborative effort to obtain an initial estimate of the reproducibility of psychological science. RESULTS We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available. There is no single standard for evaluating replication success. Here, we evaluated reproducibility using significance and P values, effect sizes, subjective assessments of replication teams, and meta-analysis of effect sizes. The mean effect size (r) of the replication effects ( M r = 0.197, SD = 0.257) was half the magnitude of the mean effect size of the original effects ( M r = 0.403, SD = 0.188), representing a substantial decline. Ninety-seven percent of original studies had significant results ( P $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .05). Thirty-six percent of replications had significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects. Correlational tests suggest that replication success was better predicted by the strength of original evidence than by characteristics of the original and replication teams. CONCLUSION No single indicator sufficiently describes replication success, and the five indicators examined here are not the only ways to evaluate reproducibility. Nonetheless, collectively these results offer a clear conclusion: A large portion of replications produced weaker evidence for the original findings despite using materials provided by the original authors, review in advance for methodological fidelity, and high statistical power to detect the original effect sizes. Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise). The latter factors certainly can influence replication success, but they did not appear to do so here. Reproducibility is not well understood because the incentives for individual scientists prioritize novelty over replication. Innovation is the engine of discovery and is vital for a productive, effective scientific enterprise. However, innovative ideas become old news fast. Journal reviewers and editors may dismiss a new test of a published idea as unoriginal. The claim that “we already know this” belies the uncertainty of scientific evidence. Innovation points out paths that are possible; replication points out paths that are likely; progress relies on both. Replication can increase certainty when findings are reproduced and promote innovation when they are not. This project provides accumulating evidence for many findings in psychological research and suggests that there is still more work to do to verify whether we know what we think we know.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Relation Between Psychopathy and Sexual Aggression: A Meta-Analysis;,citation_abstract=OBJECTIVE: Psychopathy is a multifaceted, hierarchical construct that has been linked to aggression and antisocial behavior. The triarchic model of psychopathy comprises three underlying, distinct trait domains: boldness, disinhibition, and meanness. Understanding how psychopathy at general and factor levels relates to sexual aggression is critical given its connection and the serious repercussions of sexual aggression. METHOD: This preregistered meta-analysis (k = 117) examined the relationship between psychopathy at the total construct and triarchic levels and sexual aggression in adult samples. A relative weights analysis was used to produce triarchic psychopathy scores from commonly used psychopathy measures and the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure (TriPM). RESULTS: Psychopathy evinced a moderate, positive relationship with general sexual aggression as well as most specific forms of sexual aggression except for rape and child molestation. At the triarchic level, meanness and disinhibition related positively and boldness negatively to sexual aggression. Other moderation analyses revealed significant heterogeneity in study methods and characteristics that can explain variability in psychopathy’s relations with sexual aggression. CONCLUSIONS: Psychopathy relates moderately to various forms of sexual aggression. The relationship depends on multiple factors.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is Virtual Reality Always an Effective Stressors for Exposure Treatments? Some Insights from a Controlled Trial;,citation_abstract=Background Several research studies investigating the effectiveness of the different treatments have demonstrated that exposure-based therapies are more suitable and effective than others for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Traditionally, exposure may be achieved in two manners: in vivo, with direct contact to the stimulus, or by imagery, in the person’s imagination. However, despite its effectiveness, both types of exposure present some limitations that supported the use of Virtual Reality (VR). But is VR always an effective stressor? Are the technological breakdowns that may appear during such an experience a possible risk for its effectiveness? Methods To answer these questions we compared changes following the exposure to an academic examination, one of the most universal examples of real-life stressors, in a sample of 39 undergraduate students. The same experience was offered using text (TX), audio (AU), video (VD), and VR. However, in the virtual environment we manipulated the experience introducing technological breakdowns. The Post Media Questionnaire (PMQ) and the Slater-Usoh-Steed Presence Questionnaire (SUS) were administered to each participant in order to evaluated self-report measures of anxiety and relaxation and the level of presence experience during media exposure. Electrocardiogram (ECG), Thoracic Respiration Signal (RSP) and Facial corrugator supercilii muscle Electromyography (EMG) were recorded in order to obtain objective measures of subjects’ emotional state. Results Analyses conducted on PMQ showed a significant increase in anxiety scores and a mirror decrease in relax scores after all our emotional procedures, showing that all the condition were effective in inducing a negative emotional response. Psychometric scores and psychophysiological indexes showed that VR was less effective than other procedures in eliciting stress responses. Moreover, we did not observe significative difference in SUS scores: VR induced a sense of presence similar to that experienced during the exposition to other media. Conclusions Technological breakdowns significantly reduce the possibility of VR eliciting emotions related to complex real-life stressors. Without a high sense of presence, the significant advantages offered by VR disappear and its emotional induction abilities are even lower than the ones provided by much cheaper media.

This study examines recidivism rates and risk factors among individuals involved in online child sexual exploitation, analyzing data from a sample of 228 adult males who had committed sexual and nonsexual offenses at their index crime. The findings suggest that offensesupportive cognitions (Harrell’s C = .73-.75) and emotional congruence with children (Harrell’s C = .77) serve as predictors for contact sexual recidivism. Consumption of child sexual exploitation material and bestiality pornography are linked to online sexual recidivism (.69 and .75, respectively) and negatively related to sexual recidivism (.29 and .32, respectively).

It examined recidivism rates for sexual (any, contact, and child luring) and nonsexual violent offenses, comparing men with and without intent to engage in contact sexual offenses. Results showed the Static-99R effectively predicted recidivism, with modest to strong accuracy for contact sexual recidivism (Harrell’s Cs&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.78–0.94), any sexual recidivism (Harrell’s Cs&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.66–0.80), and child luring-specific recidivism (Harrell’s Cs&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.61–0.71). Predictive validity was consistent regardless of offenders’ intent to engage in contact sexual offenses. Calibration analyses indicated the Static-99R underestimated the number of sexual recidivists in our sample. The study also highlighted differences between online and offline offenders, noting that online offenders often had numerous victims, which could complicate risk assessments.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Virtual Reality for Research in Social Neuroscience;,citation_abstract=The emergence of social neuroscience has significantly advanced our understanding of the relationship that exists between social processes and their neurobiological underpinnings. Social neuroscience research often involves the use of simple and static stimuli lacking many of the potentially important aspects of real world activities and social interactions. Whilst this research has merit, there is a growing interest in the presentation of dynamic stimuli in a manner that allows researchers to assess the integrative processes carried out by perceivers over time. Herein, we discuss the potential of virtual reality for enhancing ecological validity while maintaining experimental control in social neuroscience research. Virtual reality is a technology that allows for the creation of fully interactive, three-dimensional computerized models of social situations that can be fully controlled by the experimenter.

We examined the relationships between self-esteem, narcissism, and risk of violent (including sexual) recidivism and compared sexual offenders against children (n = 28) and non-sexual offenders (n = 44) on these measures. All participants were adult men. In both groups, greater narcissism was associated with greater risk. Among sexual offenders against children, contrary to theoretical accounts and previous research findings, higher explicit self-esteem was associated with greater risk. However, further analysis indicated that explicit self-esteem may only be relevant to recidivism risk insofar as it reflects narcissism. Neither implicit nor discrepant self-esteem were related to recidivism risk in either group. Group comparisons indicated that sexual offenders against children had lower explicit self-esteem and narcissism than non-sexual offenders. In summary, our findings suggest that although sexual offenders against children have lower explicit self-esteem and narcissism than other offenders, within this group, higher explicit self-esteem and greater narcissism may be associated with greater risk. Taken together, previous and current findings suggest that including measures of narcissism in psychological assessment batteries administered to sexual offenders against children could be beneficial.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Global Prevalence of Sexual Violence Against Children: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis;,citation_abstract=Sexual violence against children is a global concern, yet worldwide figures of its prevalence are scant.To estimate the global prevalence of sexual violence against children using national-level population-based studies.We searched the PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, ERIC, and APA PsycArticles databases from their respective inceptions to March 2022. Searches were updated through April 2024.Reports were included if (1) they were national-level population-based studies, (2) they reported lifetime or past-year prevalence data on any form of sexual violence against children (mean age $\leq$19 years), and (3) the data were based on children’s self-reports of sexual violence perpetrated by anyone.Data extraction included study and participant characteristics, prevalence rates, and types of sexual violence. Outcomes were pooled using a random-effects model. Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed with categorical moderators.Primary outcomes included lifetime and past-year prevalence of forced sexual intercourse, contact sexual violence, and sexual harassment.We identified 165 studies that included 958 182 children from 80 countries, with the majority of data focusing on girls (58.2%). The sample sizes of the studies ranged from 330 to 132 948; the mean age ranged from 10.5 to 19.4 years. Lifetime sexual harassment was the most prevalent outcome, with a pooled rate of 11.4% (95% CI, 8.5%-15.1%), followed by any contact sexual violence, with a rate of 8.7% (95% CI, 4.7%-15.5%). Furthermore, 6.1% (95% CI, 5.1%-7.3%) of children reported experiencing completed forced sexual intercourse in their lifetime, and 1.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-1.7%) reported experiencing it in the preceding year. Rates of lifetime completed forced sexual intercourse were higher among girls (6.8% [95% CI, 6.1%-7.6%]) compared with boys (3.3% [95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%]), similar to past-year violence (2.3% [95% CI 1.9%-2.7%] for girls and 0.6% [95% CI 0.4%-0.9%] for boys). We found considerable variation across regions and countries in the reported prevalence of sexual violence. Older age of children, lower national income levels, and the use of school-based surveys were associated with higher rates of sexual violence reporting in some exploratory analyses.The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the burden of sexual violence against children worldwide based on current available evidence.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Optimal Waist-to-Hip Ratios in Women Activate Neural Reward Centers in Men;,citation_abstract=Secondary sexual characteristics convey information about reproductive potential. In the same way that facial symmetry and masculinity, and shoulder-to-hip ratio convey information about reproductive/genetic quality in males, waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR) is a phenotypic cue to fertility, fecundity, neurodevelopmental resources in offspring, and overall health, and is indicative of “good genes” in women. Here, using fMRI, we found that males show activation in brain reward centers in response to naked female bodies when surgically altered to express an optimal ($\sim$0.7) WHR with redistributed body fat, but relatively unaffected body mass index (BMI). Relative to presurgical bodies, brain activation to postsurgical bodies was observed in bilateral orbital frontal cortex. While changes in BMI only revealed activation in visual brain substrates, changes in WHR revealed activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, an area associated with reward processing and decision-making. When regressing ratings of attractiveness on brain activation, we observed activation in forebrain substrates, notably the nucleus accumbens, a forebrain nucleus highly involved in reward processes. These findings suggest that an hourglass figure (i.e., an optimal WHR) activates brain centers that drive appetitive sociality/attention toward females that represent the highest-quality reproductive partners. This is the first description of a neural correlate implicating WHR as a putative honest biological signal of female reproductive viability and its effects on men’s neurological processing.;,citation_author=Steven M.

Feedback was divided into feedback regarding conclusions about what happened to the avatar (outcome feedback) and feedback regarding the appropriateness of question-types used by the interviewer (process feedback). Forty-eight participants each interviewed four different avatars. Participants were divided into four groups (no feedback, outcome feedback, process feedback, and a combination of both feedback types). Compared to the control group, interview quality was generally improved in all the feedback groups on all outcome variables included. Combined feedback produced the strongest effect on increasing recommended questions and correct conclusions. For relevant and neutral details elicited by the interviewers, no statistically significant differences were found between feedback types. For wrong details, the combination of feedback produced the strongest effect, but this did not differ from the other two feedback groups. Nevertheless, process feedback produced a better result compared to outcome feedback. The present study replicated previous findings regarding the effect of feedback in improving interview quality, and provided new knowledge on feedback characteristics that maximize training effects. A combination of process and outcome feedback showed the strongest effect in enhancing training in simulated CSA interviews.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Transfer of Simulated Interview Training Effects into Interviews with Children Exposed to a Mock Event;,citation_abstract=Research on students suggests that repeated feedback in simulated investigative interviews with avatars (computerized children) improves the quality of the interviews conducted in this simulated environment. It remains unclear whether also professional groups (psychologists) benefit from the training and if the effects obtained in the simulated interviews transfer into interviews with real children who have witnessed a mock event. We trained 40 psychologists (Study I) and 69 psychology students (Study II). In both studies, half of the participants received no feedback (control group) while the other half received feedback (experimental group) on their performance during repeated interviews with avatars. Each participant then interviewed two 4-6-year-old children who had each witnessed a different mock event without any feedback being provided. In both studies, interview quality improved in the feedback (vs. control) group during the training session with avatars. The analyses of transfer effects showed that, compared to controls, interview quality was better in the experimental group. More recommended questions were used in both studies, and more correct details were elicited from the children in Study I, during the interviews each participant conducted with two children (N $\frac{1}{4}$ 76 in Study I; N $\frac{1}{4}$ 116 in Study II) one week after the training. Although the two studies did not show statistically significant training effects for all investigated variables, we conclude that interview quality can be improved using avatar training and that there is transfer into actual interviews with children at least in the use of recommended questions.;,citation_author=Francesco Pompedda;,citation_author=Annegrete Palu;,citation_author=Kristjan Kask;,citation_author=Karolyn Schiff;,citation_author=Anna Soveri;,citation_author=Jan Antfolk;,citation_author=Pekka Santtila;,citation_publication_date=2021-01;,citation_cover_date=2021-01;,citation_year=2021;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1080/19012276.2020.1788417;,citation_issn=1901-2276, 1904-0016;,citation_volume=73;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Nordic Psychology;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Review of Digital Interventions as Secondary Prevention Measures to Combat Online Child Sexual Abuse Perpetration;,citation_abstract=Interventions implemented in the digital space play an important role in the response to global concerns about the prevalence of online child sexual abuse. Digital detection software (e.g. Sweetie) utilized to combat this behavior is a well-known example. Far fewer examples of digital interventions focused on its prevention exist. This review sought to identify digital interventions currently being implemented that aim to prevent online child sexual abuse, or intervene early, through deterrence and redirection. Guided by the PRISMA scoping review framework, a search was conducted across four databases, with snowballing from reference lists of selected sources. After exclusion criteria were applied, six sources were selected for review. Findings suggest that digital interventions (e.g. warning messages and chatbots) can be used to deter and redirect individuals at-risk of, or in the early stages of engaging in online child sexual abuse, with greater deterrent effects observed when messaging aligns with situational crime prevention principles. However, limited application and evaluation of these interventions to date constrains inferences regarding the impact of these prevention efforts. To supplement findings, several other emerging examples of digital interventions and conceptual/theoretical works (that did not meet the original inclusion criteria) are cited. Findings of this review should be considered alongside these other examples to inform the ongoing design and scaling up of digital interventions aimed at preventing online child sexual abuse.;,citation_author=S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Facial Perception of Infants with Cleft Lip and Palate with/without the NAM Appliance;,citation_abstract=Objective This study aimed to assess adults’ subjective perception of infants with a unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP) with and without a nasoalveolar molding (NAM) appliance compared to those of controls concerning (1) adult gaze patterns and (2) emotional valence. Methods This interdisciplinary study was performed by (1) the Department of Orthodontics and (2) the Department for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Medical Center Goettingen, using eye tracking and a 10-point Likert scale questionnaire. Eye movements and valence rating of 30 unaffected adults (15 women, 15 men; mean age: 25.5 years, standard deviation [SD] = 7.5) were recorded while presenting them infants in three picture categories (1) infant with UCLP, (2) infant with UCLP and inserted NAM appliance and (3) infant without UCLP. Total fixation time in two main areas of interest (AOI upper/lower face) was measured according to picture category as well as participants’ valence rating regarding infants’ appearance. Results In pictures of infants with UCLP or UCLP and NAM appliance participants had longer fixation times on AOI lower face compared to reconstructed pictures of infants without UCLP. No significant effect of a NAM appliance on gaze patterns could be detected. The valence of pictures of infants with UCLP was rated more negative compared to pictures of unaffected infants. An inserted NAM appliance improved this rating. Conclusions The results bolster the assumption that facial disruptions like UCLP alter adults’ perception of infants. Even though the NAM appliance is not able to re-establish usual adult gaze patterns, it can help to improve adults’ emotional assessment.;,citation_author=Anja Quast;,citation_author=J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sex Offenders, Internet Child Abuse Images and Emotional Avoidance: The Importance of Values;,citation_abstract=There is increasing evidence that people use the Internet to avoid negative emotional states, such as boredom, anxiety, or depression. This may be of increasing relevance for sex offenders. While the primary function of accessing the Internet for sex offenders is to obtain material that aids sexual arousal, the Internet functions to help people address some of the more immediate feelings of distress or dissatisfaction in their lives. For those with a sexual interest in children, once online offenders can then download child pornography and masturbate to such images, providing a highly rewarding or reinforcing context for further avoidance. The intensity of such behavior often has properties that offenders call daddictiveT, with high levels of activity associated with the avoidance of unpleasant emotional states. The aim of this paper is to address issues that relate to emotional avoidance. Rather than having to exclude access to computers or the Internet, offenders, in the context of making explicit personal values and goals, might be helped to accept negative emotions and commit themselves to generating behavioral goals that will move them towards what they personally value.;,citation_author=Ethel Quayle;,citation_author=Mary Vaughan;,citation_author=Max Taylor;,citation_publication_date=2006-01;,citation_cover_date=2006-01;,citation_year=2006;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.avb.2005.02.005;,citation_issn=13591789;,citation_volume=11;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Aggression and Violent Behavior;">

A close inspection of the background and of the legal objectives of the art. 64 intervention reveals that it is justified solely if it fulfills its purpose: reducing the risk of offending. The Essen Evaluation Study inspected the rate of reoffending of an unselected group of patients (n = 314) and a carefully matched control sample of prisoners with addiction problems. Length of in-patient treatment was around two years on the average, plus a several months’ period of leave of absence (before formal discharge) to reintegrate into society. However, nearly 50 percent of patients were transferred back to prison, as the prognosis of treatment seemed unfavourable. In the follow up, the complete sample of subjects initially treated was compared to the matched sample of prisoners. Using the Kaplan Meier method, the respective estimates of new convictions after 1000 days at risk were 47.3 percent in the treatment group and 67.2 percent in the control sample of prisoners (absolute risk reduction 19.9 percent). This highly significant finding confirms the rehabilitative benefit of the art 64-measure and justifies its continuance.;,citation_author=Jan Querengässer;,citation_author=Hans-Joachim Traub;,citation_publication_date=2019-08;,citation_cover_date=2019-08;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=3;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11757-019-00526-7;,citation_issn=1862-7072, 1862-7080;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=de-DE;,citation_journal_title=Forensische Psychiatrie, Psychologie, Kriminologie;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Beyond “What Works”: Implementing Sex Offender Treatment Programs in the “Real World”;,citation_abstract=Extending the “what works” tradition in correctional research, realist evaluation approaches champion the need to understand the nuances of program implementation and effectiveness, asking “what works, for whom, in what circumstances, in what respects, and how?”. This highlights the importance of understanding how programs work in “real world” settings, and not simply whether or not they produce a positive outcome overall. Informed by this approach, the current study employed focus groups and interviews with corrective services programs staff in Australia, to explore factors that impact program success and key program implementation considerations. Findings reveal system-, program-, and individual- level factors that appear to impact program success, largely by constraining program delivery. Identified implementation considerations included program design and delivery, and staffing and resources. By examining the nuances of program delivery, this study provides a better understanding of the “real-world” operation of custodial sex offender treatment programs, and adds important context to reported outcome studies.;,citation_author=Susan Rayment-McHugh;,citation_author=Emma Belton;,citation_author=Nadine McKillop;,citation_author=Larissa S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Review of Risk Factors for Online and Mixed Child Sexual Abuse Material Offending: What Is Being Researched?;,citation_abstract=The possession and distribution of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is a serious criminal offence, which is being facilitated by online technologies. To prevent, investigate, and treat online CSAM offending, comprehensive knowledge of potential risk factors for this specific criminal behaviour is required. Given the large body of relevant research, a systematic overview of the risk factors typically considered in research and their link to (testable) theories is lacking. We present a review of 43 quantitative studies (sample sizes ranging from N = 60 to N = 14,804) identified from 56 meta-analyses, reviews, and book chapters on online CSAM offending. Risk factors were extracted and grouped into 12 categories and 75 subcategories via qualitative clustering. The most frequent categories were Criminal History, Socio-Demographics, and Social Relations, whereas genuine psychological constructs were rare. Comparing risk factors for online CSAM offending to those for general (sexual) offending, the need for more specific theories of online CSAM offending is discussed along with implications for future research. Practice Impact Statement This review reports risk factors for online CSAM offending that have been researched in the psychological literature between 2011 and 2023, highlighting a lack of theory building and testing, as well as an overreliance on historic instead of psychological risk factors. As such, guidance on how to best prevent the continuation of online CSAM offending in clinical and forensic practice is limited. From this finding, requirements for future research into risk factors that may not only be more specific for online CSAM offending but are also more dynamic and psychologically relevant, as well as the development of CSAM-specific theories and risk assessment tools are derived. The advancement of our knowledge in correspondence with the identified shortcomings will be necessary to understand and prevent future CSAM offending.;,citation_author=Rebecca Reichel;,citation_author=Anton Daser;,citation_author=Frederic M.

This method tries to answer some of the shortcomings undermining current methods used in research and clinical practice of forensic psychology and rehabilitation. Among these shortcomings, threats to internal validity caused by non compliance and faking normal sexual responses are the most important ones. The victimization of actual photographed models (adults and children) to prompt sexual arousal is also ethically problematic. Hence the use of sexual avatars depicting various age periods and secondary sexual characteristics. These are used to elicit oculomotor behaviors and physiological responses expressing esthetic interest, approach and genital responses which are continuously monitored via video-oculography and penile plethysmography.

Sexual arousal was measured using circumferential penile plethysmography (PPG). Gaze behaviour dynamics was derived from average gaze radial angular deviation (GRAD) and GRAD coefficient of variation (GRADCV). Results show distinct sexual arousal profiles according to sexual preferences and point towards the existence of specific gaze behaviour dynamics guided by sexual intentions. Theoretical interpretations are based on the ecological psychology of J.J. Gibson and the integrated theory of sexual offending (Ward, 2009; Ward &amp;amp;amp; Beech, 2006).

These participants were divided into two groups according to their capacity to focus their attention in immersion (high and low focus). In order to understand sexual self-regulation better, we subjected participants to three experimental conditions: (a) immersion with a preferred sexual stimulus, without sexual inhibition; (b) immersion with a preferred sexual stimulus, with sexual inhibition; and (c) immersion with a neutral stimulus. A significant difference was observed between the effects of each condition on erectile response and scanpath. The groups differed on self-regulation of their erectile responses and on their scanpath patterns. High focus participants had more difficulties than low focus participants with inhibiting their sexual responses and displayed less scattered eye movement trajectories over the critical areas of the virtual sexual stimuli. Results are interpreted in terms of sexual self-regulation and cognitive absorption in virtual immersion. In addition, the use of validated virtual sexual stimuli is presented as a methodological improvement over static and moving pictures, since it paves the way for the study of the role of social interaction in an ecologically valid and wellcontrolled way.;,citation_author=Patrice Renaud;,citation_author=Dominique Trottier;,citation_author=Kevin Nolet;,citation_author=Joanne L.

Here, for the first time, genital arousal and pupil dilation to sexual stimuli were simultaneously assessed. These measures corresponded more strongly with each other, subjective sexual arousal, and self-reported sexual orientation in men than women. Bisexual arousal is more prevalent in women than men. We therefore predicted that if bisexual-identified men show bisexual arousal, the correspondence of their arousal indices would be more female-typical, thus weaker, than for other men. Homosexual women show more maletypical arousal than other women; hence, their correspondence of arousal indices should be stronger than for other women. Findings, albeit weak in effect, supported these predictions. Thus, if sex-specific patterns are reversed within one sex, they might affect more than one aspect of sexual arousal. Because pupillary responses reflected sexual orientation similar to genital responses, they offer a less invasive alternative for the measurement of sexual arousal.;,citation_author=Gerulf Rieger;,citation_author=Brian M.

We tested, if in brain regions subserving attentional control of behavior and perception of salient stimuli, such inhibition deficit can be observed also on the level of inhibitory neurotransmitters. We measured GABA concentration in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and in a control region, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) in pedophilic sex offenders (N = 13) and matched controls (N = 13) using a 7 Tesla STEAM magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). In dACC but not in the control region pedophilic sex offenders showed reduced GABA/Cr concentrations compared to healthy controls. The reduction was robust after controlling for potential influence of age and gray matter proportion within the MRS voxel (p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.04). Importantly, reduced GABA/Cr in patients was correlated with lower self-control measured with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (p = 0.028, r = -0.689). In a region related to cognitive control and salience mapping, pedophilic sex offenders showed reduction of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA which may be seen as a neuronal correlate of inhibition and behavioral control.;,citation_author=Inka Ristow;,citation_author=Meng Li;,citation_author=Lejla Colic;,citation_author=Vanessa Marr;,citation_author=Carina Födisch;,citation_author=Felicia Düring;,citation_author=Kolja Schiltz;,citation_author=Krasimira Drumkova;,citation_author=Joachim Witzel;,citation_author=Henrik Walter;,citation_author=Klaus Beier;,citation_author=Tillmann H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Embodied Medicine: Mens Sana in Corpore Virtuale Sano;,citation_abstract=Progress in medical science and technology drastically improved physicians’ ability to interact with patient’s physical body. Nevertheless, medicine still addresses the human body from a Hippocratic point of view, considering the organism and its processes just as a matter of mechanics and fluids. However, the interaction between the cognitive neuroscience of bodily self-consciousness (BSC), fundamentally rooted in the integration of multisensory bodily inputs, with virtual reality (VR), haptic technologies and robotics is giving a new meaning to the classic Juvenal’s latin dictum “Mens sana in corpore sano” (a healthy mind in a healthy body). This vision provides the basis for a new research field, “Embodied Medicine”: the use of advanced technologies for altering the experience of being in a body with the goal of improving health and wellbeing. Up to now, most of the research efforts in the field have been focused upon how external bodily information is processed and integrated. Despite the important results, we believe that existing bodily illusions still need to be improved to enhance their capability to effectively correct pathological dysfunctions. First, they do not follow the suggestions provided by the free-energy and predictive coding approaches. More, they lacked to consider a peculiar feature of the human body, the multisensory integration of internal inputs (interoceptive, proprioceptive and vestibular) that constitute our inner body dimension. So, a future challenge is the integration of simulation/stimulation technologies also able to measure and modulate this internal/inner experience of the body. Finally, we also proposed the concept of “Sonoception” as an extension of this approach. The core idea is to exploit recent technological advances in the acoustic field to use sound and vibrations to modify the internal/inner body experience.;,citation_author=Giuseppe Riva;,citation_author=Silvia Serino;,citation_author=Daniele Di Lernia;,citation_author=Enea Francesco Pavone;,citation_author=Antonios Dakanalis;,citation_publication_date=2017-03;,citation_cover_date=2017-03;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.3389/fnhum.2017.00120;,citation_issn=1662-5161;,citation_volume=11;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What the Metaverse Is (Really) and Why We Need to Know about It;,citation_abstract=The major technology companies are investing significant sums of money in the creation of the metaverse whose main feature will be the fusion between the virtual world and the physical one. To allow this possibility is one of the less obvious features of the metaverse: the metaverse works like our minds. This ability makes the metaverse a significantly different technology from its predecessors. If television and social media are persuasive technologies, because of their ability to influence people’s attitudes and behaviors, the metaverse is instead a transformative technology, capable of modifying what people think reality is. To achieve this goal the technologies of the metaverse hacks different key cognitive mechanisms: the experience of being in a place and in a body, the processes of brain-to-brain attunement and synchrony, and the ability of experiencing and inducing emotions. Clearly, these possibilities define totally new scenarios with positive and negative outcomes. Educating ourselves as to its promise, and the challenges it may present, is a necessity. This requires a “humane”, integrated and multidisciplinary approach, with stakeholders at the supranational level joining in the conversation.;,citation_author=Giuseppe Riva;,citation_author=Brenda Wiederhold;,citation_publication_date=2022-05;,citation_cover_date=2022-05;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.31234/osf.io/dvcmw;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Is Clinical Virtual Reality Ready for Primetime?;,citation_abstract=Objective: Since the mid-1990s, a significant scientific literature has evolved regarding the outcomes from the use of what we now refer to as Clinical Virtual Reality (VR). This use of VR simulation technology has produced encouraging results when applied to address cognitive, psychological, motor, and functional impairments across a wide range of clinical health conditions. This article addresses the question, “Is Clinical VR Ready for Primetime?” Method: After a brief description of the various forms of VR technology, we discuss the trajectory of Clinical VR over the last 20 years and summarize the basic assets that VR offers for creating clinical applications. The discussion then addresses the question of readiness in terms of the theoretical basis for Clinical VR assets, the research to date, the pragmatic factors regarding availability, usability, and costs of Clinical VR content/systems, and the ethical issues for the safe use of VR with clinical populations. Results: Our review of the theoretical underpinnings and research findings to date leads to the prediction that Clinical VR will have a significant impact on future research and practice. Pragmatic issues that can influence adoption across many areas of psychology also appear favorable, but professional guidelines will be needed to promote its safe and ethical use. Conclusions: While there is still much research needed to advance the science in this area, we strongly believe that Clinical VR applications will become indispensable tools in the toolbox of psychological researchers and practitioners and will only grow in relevance and popularity in the future.

Clinicians and researchers have worked, over the last decades, to develop effective strategies aimed at reducing sexual abuse rates. Multiple treatment approaches for sex offenders have been developed, with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) been the most widely used therapy model with recognized effectiveness. In this sense, the present study aimed to analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of CBT based interventions in the treatment of individuals convicted of sexual crimes. For this purpose, a systematic review of articles published between 2012 and 2022 was carried out in the databases Pubmed, Science Direct, APA PsycNet and Scielo, with the keywords “cognitive behavioral therapy”, “CBT”, “sexual offender”, “sexual crimes” and others. As a result, eight studies were selected that met the defined inclusion criteria. Cognitive-behavioral interventions have shown great promise in reducing sexual crime recidivism and improving self-control, emotional regulation, intra and interpersonal social skills, supporting the hypothesis that CBT may be a promising model of intervention in forensic settings with sex offenders.;,citation_author=Isabella Carvalho Oliveira Rocha;,citation_author=Alexandre Martins Valença;,citation_publication_date=2023-03;,citation_cover_date=2023-03;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.ijlp.2022.101856;,citation_issn=01602527;,citation_volume=87;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry;">

Further, certain subgroups of people attracted to children may be more stigmatized than others; this has important implications for prevention programs. We conducted a vignette study to examine whether public stigma toward people attracted to children differed based on the person’s gender (man/woman), the gender of the child to whom the person is attracted (boy/girl), and preferentiality (non-preferentially/preferentially attracted to children). A sample of 385 participants (Mage = 41; 66% White; 52% male; 57% US residents) were recruited through Prolific. Participants were randomly assigned to one of eight vignettes presenting a non-offending individual attracted to children. Vignettes varied on the person’s gender, the gender of the child to whom they were attracted, and whether they were preferentially or non-preferentially attracted to children. Participants were asked to rate their perception of risk for the person to commit a child sexual offense (and give their reasoning) as well as fill out a measure of stigma regarding the person in the vignette. The only characteristic associated with perception of risk and stigma was preferentiality; participants rated preferentially attracted persons as being a higher risk to offend and endorsed higher stigma regarding that individual. Open-ended responses indicated that in rating risk to offend, participants were concerned with the role of attraction to children, characteristics of the attraction, loss of control and opportunism, lack of offense history, and lifestyle factors.;,citation_author=Kailey Roche;,citation_author=Joelle Pagacz;,citation_author=Martin L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Enhancing Questioning Skills through Child Avatar Chatbot Training with Feedback;,citation_abstract=Training child investigative interviewing skills is a specialized task. Those being trained need opportunities to practice their skills in realistic settings and receive immediate feedback. A key step in ensuring the availability of such opportunities is to develop a dynamic, conversational avatar, using artificial intelligence (AI) technology that can provide implicit and explicit feedback to trainees. In the iterative process, use of a chatbot avatar to test the language and conversation model is crucial. The model is fine-tuned with interview data and realistic scenarios. This study used a pre-post training design to assess the learning effects on questioning skills across four child interview sessions that involved training with a child avatar chatbot fine-tuned with interview data and realistic scenarios. Thirty university students from the areas of child welfare, social work, and psychology were divided into two groups; one group received direct feedback ( n  = 12), whereas the other received no feedback ( n  = 18). An automatic coding function in the language model identified the question types. Information on question types was provided as feedback in the direct feedback group only. The scenario included a 6-year-old girl being interviewed about alleged physical abuse. After the first interview session (baseline), all participants watched a video lecture on memory, witness psychology, and questioning before they conducted two additional interview sessions and completed a post-experience survey. One week later, they conducted a fourth interview and completed another post-experience survey. All chatbot transcripts were coded for interview quality. The language model’s automatic feedback function was found to be highly reliable in classifying question types, reflecting the substantial agreement among the raters [Cohen’s kappa ($\kappa$) = 0.80] in coding open-ended, cued recall, and closed questions. Participants who received direct feedback showed a significantly higher improvement in open-ended questioning than those in the non-feedback group, with a significant increase in the number of open-ended questions used between the baseline and each of the other three chat sessions. This study demonstrates that child avatar chatbot training improves interview quality with regard to recommended questioning, especially when combined with direct feedback on questioning.;,citation_author=Ragnhild Klingenberg Røed;,citation_author=Gunn Astrid Baugerud;,citation_author=Syed Zohaib Hassan;,citation_author=Saeed S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Synthesizing a Talking Child Avatar to Train Interviewers Working with Maltreated Children;,citation_abstract=When responding to allegations of child sexual, physical, and psychological abuse, Child Protection Service (CPS) workers and police personnel need to elicit detailed and accurate accounts of the abuse to assist in decision-making and prosecution. Current research emphasizes the importance of the interviewer’s ability to follow empirically based guidelines. In doing so, it is essential to implement economical and scientific training courses for interviewers. Due to recent advances in artificial intelligence, we propose to generate a realistic and interactive child avatar, aiming to mimic a child. Our ongoing research involves the integration and interaction of different components with each other, including how to handle the language, auditory, emotional, and visual components of the avatar. This paper presents three subjective studies that investigate and compare various state-of-the-art methods for implementing multiple aspects of the child avatar. The first user study evaluates the whole system and shows that the system is well received by the expert and highlights the importance of its realism. The second user study investigates the emotional component and how it can be integrated with video and audio, and the third user study investigates realism in the auditory and visual components of the avatar created by different methods. The insights and feedback from these studies have contributed to the refined and improved architecture of the child avatar system which we present here.;,citation_author=Pegah Salehi;,citation_author=Syed Zohaib Hassan;,citation_author=Myrthe Lammerse;,citation_author=Saeed Shafiee Sabet;,citation_author=Ingvild Riiser;,citation_author=Ragnhild Klingenberg Røed;,citation_author=Miriam S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Rights, Child Rights, and the Ethics of Prevention: Rethinking the Child Sexual Abuse Doll Debate;,citation_abstract=This commentary responds to Cuvalo and Wekerle’s (2025) argument for analysing child sexual abuse dolls through the lens of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and related human rights instruments. Their framing provides an essential corrective to recent claims that such dolls may serve as tools for abuse prevention or harm reduction. Drawing on empirical, ethical, and discursive evidence, this commentary examines the convergence between pro-paedophile online subcultures advocating for lawful access to child sexual abuse dolls and a subset of academic research that reproduces their rhetoric of “harm reduction” and “sexual wellbeing.” It argues that this body of scholarship represents a normative shift toward a framework of “paedophile rights,” which positions paedophilia as an oppressed sexual identity rather than a disorder associated with elevated risks of offending and co-occurring paraphilias. Recentring the debate within international child rights law exposes the fundamental asymmetry between the rights of children to safety and dignity and the purported sexual rights of adults who are sexually attracted to them. The commentary concludes that child sexual abuse prevention must remain grounded in the primacy of children’s rights and public protection, rejecting ideological or therapeutic justifications that normalise or accommodate the sexualisation of children.;,citation_author=Michael Salter;,citation_publication_date=2025-12;,citation_cover_date=2025-12;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2025.107811;,citation_issn=0145-2134;,citation_volume=170;,citation_journal_title=Child Abuse &amp;amp;amp; Neglect;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Can Virtual Reality Be Used for the Prevention of Peer Sexual Harassment in Adolescence? First Evaluation of the Virtual-PRO Program;,citation_abstract=Objective: The present study analyzed the Virtual-PRO program’s efficacy in preventing peer sexual harassment by promoting the bystanders’ active intervention and incorporating a virtual reality (VR) component. The impact of the program on sexist attitudes, moral disengagement, the intention to intervene as bystanders, and the involvement in sexual aggression and victimization was tested. Method: Virtual-PRO is a VR-enhanced sexual harassment curricular prevention program of six one-hour sessions. The evaluation comprised a pre-test, a post-test after the intervention, and a follow-up measure at three months. In the study, 579 Spanish adolescent students aged between 12 and 17 years (M = 14.76, SD = 0.88; 47.1% boys) were randomly grouped into experimental (n = 286) and control (n = 293) conditions. Results: The Virtual-PRO program effectively controlled participants’ levels of sexism and reduced moral disengagement in the experimental group compared to the control group three months after the intervention. The program also showed positive results in changing bystander behavior, increasing the intention to intervene when the victim was not a friend. Finally, visual/verbal and online victimization decreased in the experimental group and increased in the control group. No differences were found for physical sexual victimization and sexual aggression. Conclusions: The first trial of the VirtualPRO program is promising and highlights the use of VR as a sexual harassment prevention tool.

The current study investigates whether the foundation of a professionalized follow-up-treatment has actually improved release options for individuals who committed sexual offenses. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the difference in criminogenic needs and recidivism relevant characteristics (e.g., index offense, criminal history, psychiatric diagnoses and risk assessment) between three groups who had been released from forensic psychiatry at different times or under different outpatient follow-up modalities: (1) individuals released prior the foundation of professionalized follow-up-treatment, (2) individuals released after the foundation and received treatment, and (3) individuals released after the foundation but not receiving this special treatment. It was found that with the availability of professionalized forensic followup treatment, persons with higher scores in common risk assessment tools and a longer duration of implacement had been released. Indeed, this indicates an increased risk tolerance among decision makers. However, it was not those who were released after the foundation of the professionalized forensic follow-up treatment but without this specific treatment who showed the lowest initial risk, but those who were released prior to the foundation.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Impact of Testosterone-Lowering Medication on Recidivism in Individuals Convicted of Sexual Offenses;,citation_abstract=Introduction: Treatment of individuals who have committed sexual offences with TestosteroneLowering Medication (TLM) is a comparatively intrusive kind of intervention, which regularly takes place in coercive contexts. Thus, the question of efficacy, but also the question of who should be treated, when and for how long, are of great importance. Methods: Recidivism rates of TLM-treated high-risk individuals (TLM; n $\frac{1}{4}$ 54) were compared with high-risk individuals treated with psychotherapy only in the same forensic outpatient clinic (-TLM; n $\frac{1}{4}$ 79). Results: Group differences suggested a higher initial risk of  TLM (e.g. higher ris-assessment, previous convictions). Despite the increased risk, after an average time at risk of six years, TLM recidivated significantly less often and significantly later than - TLM (27.8% vs. 51.9%). Such an effect was also found for violent (1.9% vs. 15.2%), but not for sexual (5.6% vs. 10.1%) and ser ious recidivism (5.6% vs. 10.1%), which could be explained partly by the small number of cases. In the course of treatment, TLM proved to be a significant variable for a positive process, whereas a high risk-assessment score indicated a rather negative course. In total, n $\frac{1}{4}$ 19 individ uals had stopped their TLM treatment, of these 31.6% recidivated. Conclusion: The results support the efficacy of TLM, particularly in the group of high-risk offenders.;,citation_author=Julia Sauter;,citation_author=Laura M.

The present quasi-experimental study aims at comparing differences in clinical characteristics and dynamic risk factors between persons receiving (+TLM, n = 38) versus not receiving (-TLM, n = 22) testosterone-lowering medications (TLMs). Individuals receiving TLM were more frequently diagnosed with paraphilic disorders. Neither the criminal history nor average risk scores differed between the two groups. In the +TLM, Stable-2007 scores showed a stronger decrease after TLM treatment was started. This accounted especially for the general and sexual self-regulation subscales. Individual variations in risk, however, were not predicted by TLM but were significantly related to treatment duration and Psychopathy Checklist–Revised (PCL-R) Factor I. Paraphilic patients with problems in self-regulatory abilities seem to profit most from pharmacological sex drive–reducing treatment.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What I Missed from My Online Therapist: A Survey-Based Qualitative Investigation of Patient Experiences of Therapist Contact in Guided Internet Interventions;,citation_abstract=Background: The effectiveness of internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) in alleviating symptoms of psychological disorders has been demonstrated across qualitative and quantitative studies. Generally, guided ICBT is considered more effective than unguided ICBT. Yet, what therapist contact and guidance specifically add to the treatment is less clear. There is a need for more knowledge about how patients experience the relationship with their therapist in guided ICBT. The aim of the study was to explore what patients missed in the contact with their therapist in guided ICBT in routine care. Methods: The study used a qualitative design to explore patients experiences of the therapist contact in guided ICBT for social anxiety disorder, panic disorder and major depressive disorder. Following treatment, 579 patients received a survey with the open-ended question “What did you miss in the contact with your therapist?” The responses were explored thematically using qualitative content analysis. Results: A total of 608 unique responses were provided. Of these, 219 responses gave voice to some degree of perceived lack or limitation in their interaction with the therapist or the treatment in general. The analysis yielded three main categories: The first theme, Therapist-ascribed shortcomings, concerned experiences of something missing or lacking in the contact with the ICBT therapist. More specifically, the patients expressed a need for more emotionally attuned and tailored interaction. The second theme was Program obstacles, encompassing expressed wishes for increased therapist responsivity and more contact face-to-face. Self-attributed limitations, the third category, concerned patient experiences of barriers to treatment engagement as originating in themselves. Conclusion: This study sheds light on what patients receiving guided ICBT in routine care missed in the contact with their therapist. The patients who expressed that something was missing in the contact with their therapist constituted a small part of the responses in the sample, even after being directly asked. The themes that emerged point to significant experiences of being inadequately related and responded to, both with potential adverse consequences for the treatment. These findings give new insights to the role of the guidance in ICBT and have implications for the training and supervision of guided ICBT therapists.;,citation_author=Hanna Sayar;,citation_author=Jon Vøllestad;,citation_author=Tine Nordgreen;,citation_publication_date=2023-02;,citation_cover_date=2023-02;,citation_year=2023;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2023.990833;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=14;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;">

Emotion regulation strategies and confounding variables were entered as predictors in multinomial logistic regression analyses. Results: Emotion suppression, but not reappraisal, was found to predict therapy outcomes for in- and outpatients, with patients high in suppression experiencing worse outcomes.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Negative Affect Repair Questionnaire: Factor Analysis and Psychometric Evaluation in Three Samples;,citation_abstract=Background: Negative affect and difficulties in its regulation have been connected to several adverse psychological consequences. While several questionnaires exist, it would be important to have a theory-based measure that includes clinically relevant items and shows good psychometric properties in healthy and patient samples. This study aims at developing such a questionnaire, combining the two Gross [1] scales Reappraisal and Suppression with an additional response-focused scale called Externalizing Behavioral Strategies covering clinically relevant items. Methods: The samples consisted of 684 students (mean age = 23.3, SD = 3.5; 53.6% female) and 369 persons with mixed mental disorders (mean age = 36.0 SD = 14.6; 71.2% female). Items for the questionnaire were derived from existing questionnaires and additional items were formulated based on suggestions by clinical experts. All items start with “When I don’t feel well, in order to feel better. . .”. Participants rated how frequently they used each strategy on a 5-point Likert scale. Confirmatory Factor Analyses were conducted to verify the factor structure in two separate student samples and a clinical sample. Group comparisons and correlations with other questionnaires were calculated to ensure validity. Results: After modification, the CFA showed good model fit in all three samples. Reliability scores (Cronbach’s $\alpha$) for the three NARQ scales ranged between .71 and .80. Comparisons between students and persons with mental disorders showed the postulated relationships, as did comparisons between male and female students and persons with or without Borderline Personality Disorder.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Why Mental Disorders Are Brain Disorders. And Why They Are Not: ADHD and the Challenges of Heterogeneity and Reification;,citation_abstract=Scientific attempts to identify biomarkers to reliably diagnose mental disorders have thus far been unsuccessful. This has inspired the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) approach which decomposes mental disorders into behavioral, emotional, and cognitive domains. This perspective article argues that the search for biomarkers in psychiatry presupposes that the present mental health categories reflect certain (neuro-) biological features, that is, that these categories are reified as biological states or processes. I present two arguments to show that this assumption is very unlikely: First, the heterogeneity (both within and between subjects) of mental disorders is grossly underestimated, which is particularly salient for an example like Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Second, even the search for the biological basis of psychologically more basic categories (cognitive and emotional processes) than the symptom descriptions commonly used in mental disorder classifications has thus far been inconclusive. While philosophers have discussed this as the problem of mind-body-reductionism for ages, Turkheimer presented a theoretical framework comparing weak and strong biologism which is more useful for empirical research. This perspective article concludes that mental disorders are brain disorders in the sense of weak , but not strong biologism. This has important implications for psychiatric research: The search for reliable biomarkers for mental disorder categories we know is unlikely to ever be successful. This implies that biology is not the suitable taxonomic basis for psychiatry, but also psychology at large.;,citation_author=Stephan Schleim;,citation_publication_date=2022-08;,citation_cover_date=2022-08;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2022.943049;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;">

This research sought to elucidate the link between outpatient therapists’ stigmatizing attitudes toward non-offending vs. offending MAPs and therapists’ willingness to treat MAPs as well as how stigmatization was related to treatment-relevant aspects such as perceived MAP treatment needs, treatment barriers, and specific MAP treatment skills. Results from a brief, anonymous online survey conducted among N = 427 Swiss outpatient therapists working in the primary healthcare system are reported. Although therapists were less stigmatizing than the general public, considerable individual differences in the stigmatization of non-offending MAPs emerged. Stigmatizing attitudes toward non-offending MAPs and a perceived lack of specific treatment competences were negatively related to therapists’ willingness to treat MAPs. A network analysis revealed direct links between subjectively perceived MAP treatment competence and treatment willingness and between treatment willingness and social distance attitudes. Other stigmatizing attitudes were only indirectly linked to treatment willingness through preferred social distance. It is a paradox that therapists believe that MAPs should greatly benefit from secondary prevention but many are unwilling to provide therapy (45% in case of non-offending MAPs vs. 63% in case of offending MAPs) or do not feel competent to provide MAPs with professional help (47% with and 88% of therapists without previous MAP treatment experience).

In a mixed sample of adult men (N = 304, including sexual offenders against children, as well as sex offenders against adults, non-sex offender and non-offender controls), 27% of the offenders convicted for child sexual abuse or child pornography charges were identified as a homogeneous and distinct latent class. Additional taxometric analyses corroborated the notion of a pedophilic subgroup. Individuals in this pedophilic group showed elevated scores on measures of deviant sexual preference for children over adults.

Although the long-term psychological impacts of OCSA are increasingly recognized, there remains limited guidance for practitioners on how best to assess and respond effectively to its specific features. This study aimed to explore practitioners’ and researchers’ perspectives on current gaps in service provision, assessment practices, and interventions for young people affected by OCSA. An open-ended online questionnaire was emailed to UK-based practitioners (n = 10) and researchers with published expertise in OCSA (n = 36), of whom seven also had clinical experience (i.e., clinical psychologists, psychiatrists). A total of 46 responses were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Most participants defined OCSA broadly as “any sexually abusive act by an adult or peer with a digital or online component”. Both practitioners and researchers emphasized the need for responses that include psychoeducation, trauma-informed care, and safeguarding measures. Participants also highlighted challenges unique to OCSA, such as the permanence of abuse imagery and the perceived agency of victims in online interactions, factors which were seen to require specialized responses. Despite these needs, both groups highlighted gaps in specialist support, practitioner training, and co-ordinated multi-agency responses. The findings highlight the urgent need for further research to develop consensus-based, evidence-informed approaches to OCSA-specific assessment and intervention, ensuring services are equipped to meet the needs of this vulnerable population.;,citation_author=Felipa Schmidt;,citation_author=Ethel Quayle;,citation_author=Sandra Bucci;,citation_publication_date=2025-09;,citation_cover_date=2025-09;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1602449;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=16;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;,citation_publisher=Frontiers;">

Relying on self-reports of sexual inclinations as sole diagnostic source is fraught with obvious limitations when working with individuals who may face extensive personal ramifications from the justice system. This chapter gives a brief overview of indirect measures of pedohebephilic interest as a promising diagnostic adjunct. After reviewing validated indirect assessment paradigms, we focus on Viewing Time measures and Implicit Association Tests as the most frequently empirically examined indirect measures. Introducing the Explicit and Implicit Sexual Interest Profile (EISIP), the diagnostic potential of combining conceptually different measures into a test-battery will be outlined. Given that the applied forensic field requires diagnostic decisions at the individual level, we underscore the importance of measurement reliability. The underlying psychological processes of Viewing Time measures and their relation to the fakeability of indirect measures are explained.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexual Offender Treatment for Reducing Recidivism among Convicted Sex Offenders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis;,citation_abstract=Background Sexual offender treatment programs to reduce reoffending have been implemented in many countries as part of a strategy in managing this offender group. However, there are still controversies regarding their effectiveness. Objectives A meta-analysis of relatively well-controlled outcome evaluations assessing the effects of treatment for male sexual offenders to reduce recidivism is conducted. The aim is to provide robust estimates of overall and differential treatment effects. Search methods We searched a broad range of literature databases, scanned previous reviews and primary studies on the topic, hand-searched 16 relevant journals, carried out an internet search of pertinent institutions, and personally contacted experts in the field of sex offender treatment. In total, we identified more than 3,000 documents that were scanned for eligibility. Selection criteria Studies had to address male sexual offenders and contain an outcome evaluation with a treated group (TG) and an equivalent control group (CG). Apart from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), also quasi-experimental designs were eligible if they applied sound matching procedures, statistically controlled for potential biases or the incidental assignment would not introduce bias. The studies had to evaluate therapeutic measures aiming at reducing recidivism. Both, psychosocial and organic treatment approaches were eligible. Case reports were not eligible and sample size had to be at least n =10. To be eligible, studies had to report official recidivism data as an outcome and provide sufficient information for effect size calculation. There were no restrictions with regard to country of origin or language and both published and unpublished documents were eligible. Data collection and analysis For each study/comparison we coded general features, characteristics of the sample, treatment variables and methodological features. As most studies reported their results in terms of recidivism rates, we chose the odds ratio (OR) as effect size measure. If results on treatment dropouts were provided, we merged them with the treatment group results (“intent to treat” analysis). All statistical analysis of effect sizes applied a random effects model. Results 29 comparisons drawn from 27 studies met our inclusion criteria. This study pool comprised 4,939 treated and 5,448 untreated offenders. A quarter of the studies were retrieved from unpublished sources. Most studies appeared since 2000 and more than half came from North America. The evaluations mostly addressed cognitive-behavioral sex offender treatment. No study on hormonal treatment met the inclusion criteria. Only about one fifth of the comparisons were RCTs and matching designs were rare as well. The follow-up periods ranged from 1 to 19.5 years (M = 5.9 years). Most frequently recidivism was defined as a new conviction and with only one exception studies presented data on sexual reoffending. Overall, there was a positive, statistically significant effect of treatment on sexual reoffending (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.11 to 1.78, p $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ .01). The mean effect equates to 26.3% less recidivism after treatment (sexual recidivism rate of 10.1% in treated sex offenders vs. 13.7 % in the control groups). There was a comparable effect on general recidivism (26.4% less recidivism in treated groups; OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.83, p $&amp;lt;$ .01). The overall effects were robust against outliers, but contained much heterogeneity. Cognitive-behavioral programs showed a significant effect. Two RCTs on Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST) which also contains many cognitive-behavioral elements revealed a particularly large effect. Other intervention types showed weaker or no effects. There was a rather clear trend for better treatment effects of more individualized programs. There was no significant difference between various settings. We found significant effects for treatment in the community and in forensic hospitals, but there is not yet sufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of sex offender treatment in prisons. The overall methodological quality of the studies was not significantly related to effect size. It should be noted, though, that we could not demonstrate a significant effect on sexual reoffending for the few RCTs in our study pool. Sample size was not linearly related to effect size but small studies with fewer than 50 participants had larger effects. This may suggest publication selection bias. However, studies from unpublished sources did not reveal weaker effects compared to published studies. The strongest methodological moderator was descriptive validity. Most studies lacked a detailed documentation of offender variables so that only few analyses could target this factor. With regard to offender characteristics we found no significant treatment effect for low risk participants. In contrast, medium and higher risk groups benefitted from treatment. Although the treatment of adolescents fared somewhat better than for adults, this difference was not significant. It made no difference whether offenders entered treatment voluntarily or on a mandatory basis. Authors’ conclusions Overall, the findings are promising, but there is too much heterogeneity between the results of individual studies to draw a generally positive conclusion about the effectiveness of sex offender treatment. However, the results reveal information that is practically relevant: For example, our review confirms that cognitive-behavioral programs and multi-systemic approaches are more effective than other types of psychosocial interventions. The findings also suggest various conditions of success such as more individualization instead of fully standardized group programs, an advantage of treatment in the community or therapeutic settings instead of prisons, a focus on medium to high risk offenders, early treatment of young sexual offenders, and measures to ensure quality of implementation. Overall, and particularly with regard to moderators, the research base on sex offender treatment is still not yet satisfactory. To enable more definite answers, more high-quality research is needed, particularly outside North America. There is a clear need of more differentiated process and sound outcome evaluations on various types of interventions (including pharmacological treatment), specific characteristics of programs, implementation, settings and participants and research methods.;,citation_author=Martin Schmucker;,citation_author=Friedrich Lösel;,citation_publication_date=2017-07;,citation_cover_date=2017-07;,citation_year=2017;,citation_doi=10.4073/csr.2017.8;,citation_volume=13;,citation_journal_title=Campbell Systematic Reviews;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Identification of Individual Walking Patterns Using Time Discrete and Time Continuous Data Sets;,citation_abstract=Scientific studies typically treat data by studying effects of groups. Clinical therapy typically treats patients on a subject specific basis. Consequently, scientific and clinical attempts to help patients are often not coordinated. The purposes of this study were (a) to identify subject and group specific locomotion characteristics quantitatively, using time discrete and time continuous data and (b) to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches. Kinematic and kinetic gait pattern of 13 female subjects walking in dress shoes with different heel heights (14, 37, 54 and 85 mm) were analysed. The results of this study showed that subject specific gait characteristics could be better identified with the time continuous than with the time discrete approach. Thus, the time continuous approach using artificial networks is an effective tool for identifying subject and group specific locomotion characteristics. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Acceptance of a Web-Based Intervention in Individuals Who Committed Sexual Offenses Against Children: Cross-Sectional Study;,citation_abstract=Background: Individuals who have committed sexual offenses against children often have difficulties finding treatment, despite its potential effectiveness. Although the development of web-based interventions could enhance therapeutic supply, up to now the acceptance thereof among this target group is unknown. Objective: For the first time, this study assesses the acceptance of a web-based intervention among individuals who committed sexual offenses against children and analyzes variables that predict acceptance. Following the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), it is assumed that acceptance of web-based interventions in individuals who have committed sexual offenses against children follows the same mechanisms as for individuals in general psychiatry. Methods: This cross-sectional study is based on the data from an ongoing clinical trial (@myTabu) evaluating the effectiveness of a web-based intervention in individuals who committed sexual offenses against children (N=113). Acceptance level was measured using a questionnaire based on the UTAUT and modified for the target group. Furthermore, predictors of acceptance from the UTAUT (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence [SI]), attitudes toward web-based interventions, and internet anxiety were assessed at baseline. Results: Most participants (61.1%, 69/113), reported high acceptance, while 36.3% (41/113) of them indicated moderate acceptance, and 2.7% (3/113) of them expressed low acceptance. In a linear regression model, the predictors explained 41.2% of the variance (F11,101=9.055; P=.01). Attitudes toward web-based interventions (B=0.398, 95% CI 0.16-0.64; P=.001) and SI (B=0.183, 95% CI 0.03-0.38; P=.04) significantly predicted acceptance. Post hoc explorative analysis showed that the participants’ belief that people close to them would recommend the use of a web-based intervention is a predictor of acceptance. In contrast, the belief that their community supervisor would recommend the use thereof was not predictive in this respect. Conclusions: For the participants of this study, we identified high acceptance of web-based interventions for the majority of participants. SI and the participants’ attitudes toward web-based interventions were important in predicting acceptance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Engagement in a Web-Based Intervention for Individuals Who Committed Sexual Offenses against Children: Observational Study;,citation_abstract=Web-based interventions have been shown to be effective for various health and mental health problems. However, the effectiveness of interventions is often limited by the fact that individuals do not start or complete them. Using data from an intermediate analysis of the randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of @myTabu, the current study investigated engagement with a web-based intervention for 113 individuals convicted of child sexual abuse and/or for child sexual exploitation material. @myTabu is a human-supported, web-based intervention for individuals who have been convicted for sexual abuse of children or the use of child sexual exploitation material with the goal of reducing the risk factors for recidivism and actual recidivism. The results of the present study indicate that (a) 81% of the participants logged into the web-based intervention within 8 weeks after login credentials were sent; (b) there was a trend toward lower treatment readiness and lower belief in their own technical prerequisites in individuals who did not login; (c) 15% of the participants completed all requested sessions within the first 5 weeks of participation, and the average participant logged in on 6 different days and completed two sessions; (d) the number of login days and completed sessions could be predicted by treatment readiness.

This paper gives an up-to-date overview of research in this diverse field. It starts with the most prevailing definitions and theories on presence, most of which attribute special roles for the mental process of attention and for mental models of the virtual space. A review of the phenomena thought to be effected by presence shows that there is still a strong need for research on this subject because little conclusive evidence exists regarding the relationship between presence and phenoma such as emotional responses to virtual stimuli. An investigation shows there has been substantial research for developing methods for measuring presence and research regarding factors that contribute to presence.

Objective: Troubled Desire aims to address this shortage by offering self-assessment and self-management training modules for individuals who feel sexually attracted to prepubescent and early pubescent children (ie, pedophilic and hebephilic sexual interest) in seven different language versions. Methods: The present study analyzed characteristics of users within the first 30 months (25.10.2017-25.04.2020). Results: The self-assessment was completed by 4161 users from all over the world. The majority (78.9%, n=3281) reported pedophilic and/or hebephilic sexual interest. Of those with pedophilic and/or hebephilic sexual interest, 72.8% (n=2390) have used child sexual abuse material and 41.5% (n=1363) indicated they had sexually abused a child or children. The vast majority of offenses were committed within the “Dunkelfeld” (ie, not known to legal authorities).

In addition, even more cases regarding the distribution of child pornography have been reported. On behalf of victims of child sexual abuse and for the general public, a preventive treatment approach for people with a sexual interest in children is of prime importance. Currently, there is no published evaluated therapeutic approach for treating potential offenders, dark field offenders and bright field offenders with a sexual interest in children in an outpatient setting. We designed a cognitive-behavioral therapeutic approach that integrated need- and resource-oriented concepts for the specific treatment of those people. This treatment program comprises thirteen modules and is established for a period of about one and a half year. The therapy concept is presented in detail and we report experiences with two male clients. We found a reduction of child abusive behavior (on- and off-line), cognitive distortions and subjective psychological distress, an increase of the extent of self-perceived sexual self-regulation, life satisfaction and self-efficacy in general and a high level of clients’ satisfaction with the therapy concept. The present therapy concept shows promising results as a potential viable treatment program to protect children by reaching out to people with a self-reported sexual interest in children in an outpatient setting, but further research is necessary.;,citation_author=Tina Schulz;,citation_author=Simon Palmer;,citation_author=Georg Stolpmann;,citation_author=Martina Wernicke;,citation_author=Jürgen L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Concurrent and Predictive Validity of the Instrument for Forensic Treatment Evaluation: From Risk Assessment to Routine, Multidisciplinary Treatment Evaluation;,citation_abstract=Besides assessment of forensic patients’ risk of future violence and criminogenic needs, knowledge on their responsivity to treatment is equally important. However, instruments currently used for risk assessment are not sensitive enough for treatment evaluation. Therefore, the Instrument for Forensic Treatment Evaluation (IFTE) was developed. The IFTE is a treatment evaluation tool, which uses the dynamic risk items of the Dutch risk assessment tool, the HKT-R (Historical, Clinical, Future–Revised). The IFTE has an extended answering scale, which makes it more sensitive for measuring change and enables clinicians to monitor patients’ responsivity to treatment closely. This study examines the concurrent and predictive validity of the IFTE. We found moderate to strong correlations between IFTE items and HKT-30 items (the HKT-30 is the predecessor of the HKT-R), with work and therapy attendance, and positive drug tests. In addition, we found moderate to modest correlations between some IFTE items and work and therapy attendance in a 6-month follow-up period and modest to high discriminative power for some IFTE items for violence and drug use 6 months after the measurement. Given its good reliability and validity properties, and comprehensive but short-term nature, implementation of the IFTE in forensic practice likely improves individual treatment of forensic psychiatric patients and has high potential for risk management purposes.;,citation_author=Erwin Schuringa;,citation_author=V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Virtual Reality-Based Retrospective Think Aloud (VR-RTA): A Novel Method for Studying Offender Decision-Making;,citation_abstract=Objectives This article describes and tests a novel multi-method approach to examine decision-making: Virtual Reality-Based Retrospective Think-Aloud (VR-RTA). The VR-RTA method taps into the offender perspective and aims to enhance memory recall and information elicitation. Methods We applied VR-RTA among a sample of incarcerated burglars (N = 200) who scouted virtual neighborhoods to explore opportunities for burglary in immersive VR equipped with integrated eye tracking. Subsequently, they viewed a screen recording of their scouting process and simultaneously “thought aloud” about their assessment of the environment and decision-making strategies. Emerging themes were then further examined in an interview and linked to survey data. Recorded eye tracking data were used to examine burglars’ attention towards environmental features to identify deterrent and attracting cues, and were triangulated with the survey and interview data. Results Rich and detailed insights into participants’ interpretation of the environment and their decision-making strategies were obtained. VR-RTA assisted in verbalizing automated cognitive processes and increased participant engagement by building rapport. Conclusions As a multi-method approach able to capture in-the-moment considerations underlying decisionmaking during crime commission, VR-RTA offers potential to develop into an important tool for crime research. It is able to both overcome limitations of studies using retrospective methods, such as interviews and surveys, and contribute to the nascent field of criminological research using immersive technologies.;,citation_author=Carmen-Silva Sergiou;,citation_author=Dominik Gerstner;,citation_author=Claire Nee;,citation_author=Henk Elffers;,citation_author=Jean-Louis Van Gelder;,citation_publication_date=2024-11;,citation_cover_date=2024-11;,citation_year=2024;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s40163-024-00236-4;,citation_issn=2193-7680;,citation_volume=13;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Crime Science;">

Two risk factors previously deemed promising by Mann et al.

Originally developed to explain contact sexual offending against children, the motivation-facilitation model was subsequently extended as an explanation for child pornography offending and for online solicitations of young adolescents. Here, I argue it has the potential to be expanded to explain other forms of sexual offending, including sexual assaults of adults and noncontact offenses involving exhibitionism or voyeurism.

The CPORT items comprised younger offender age, any prior criminal history, any contact sexual offending, any failure on conditional release, indication of sexual interest in child pornography material or prepubescent or pubescent children, more boy than girl content in child pornography, and more boy than girl content in other child depictions. The CPORT was significantly associated with any sexual recidivism, with moderate predictive accuracy, and thus has promise in the risk assessment of adult male child pornography offenders with further cross-validation.;,citation_author=Michael C.

Both SSPI and SSPI-2 scores were significantly and positively related to sexual rearrest, but the SSPI-2 provided greater discrimination in rearrest within 5 years across possible scores. Neither measure significantly added to the prediction of sexual rearrest provided by the Static-99R. We also found evidence of concurrent validity, as both measures were positively and significantly correlated with clinician ratings of sexual preoccupation, emotional identification with children, and sexual offense–related cognitions (convergent validity), but were not significantly related to clinician ratings of self-regulation problems, noncompliance with supervision, or antisocial personality (divergent validity).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Revised Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests (SSPI–2): Development and Criterion-Related Validation;,citation_abstract=The Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests (SSPI) is a structured rating scale of four child victim characteristics: number, age, gender, and relationship of victims. Sexual offenders against children who score higher on the SSPI are more likely to be identified as having pedophilic sexual arousal and are more likely to sexually reoffend. Recent research suggests that child pornography offending is a valid and perhaps independent indicator of pedophilia. In this study, we examined whether child pornography offending would add to the criterion-related validity of the SSPI. In the construction sample of 950 offenders with child victims, the SSPI with a fifth item of child pornography (Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests–2 [SSPI-2]) was significantly associated with phallometrically assessed sexual arousal to children. In a validation sample of 950 offenders with child victims, the SSPI2 was again related to phallometrically assessed sexual arousal to children, outperforming the original SSPI.

Pages for self-help seekers were compared to pages for parents/ caregivers and general audiences. Based on descriptive data, there was mixed evidence of an increased demand for self-help, with an increase in helpline inquiries and an increase in views for some but not all self-help pages. Webpage trends for self-help pages were not matched by similar trends for parent/caregiver or general information pages, suggesting the increase in demand was specific to self-help seeking. However, ANOVAs of both US and UK and Ireland webpage data did not result in a significant interaction effect between category (self-help, parent, or general) and time. While there were significant increases in self-help related helpline calls in the USA across time, all three types of helpline calls increased in the UK and Ireland.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Cross-Validation of the German Version of the Revised Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests (SSPI-2);,citation_abstract=Pedophilic interests are considered as one of the most important diagnostic aspects and one of the strongest predictors of sexual recidivism among persons convicted of sexual offenses against children. The Revised Screening Scale for Pedophilic Interests (SSPI-2) is a comparatively easy-to-score diagnostic actuarial instrument to assess pedohebephilic interests. The present study aimed to examine the convergent, predictive, and incremental validity of the German version of the SSPI-2 in a sample of N = 438 males released from the Austrian prison system who had been convicted and incarcerated because of sexual offenses against children. As expected, the SSPI-2 was moderately correlated with a diagnosis of (exclusive) pedophilia and with the risk assessment instruments Static-99 and Sexual Violence Risk-20 (SVR-20) v2. The examination of the predictive validity revealed moderate effect sizes of the SSPI-2 for the prediction of sexually motivated recidivism. Sequential Cox regressions showed that the SSPI-2 incrementally predicts sexual recidivism and sexual noncontact recidivism beyond the SVR-20 v2 and the diagnosis of exclusive pedophilia; however, the SSPI-2 did not have incremental predictive validity beyond the Static-99. Finally, normative data were constructed for the observed and calculated proportions of pedophilia and exclusive pedophilia diagnoses and for 5-year sexual recidivism rates.;,citation_author=Sita Sophie Sielaff;,citation_author=Reinhard Eher;,citation_author=Sonja Etzler;,citation_author=Martin Rettenberger;,citation_publication_date=2025-07;,citation_cover_date=2025-07;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1177/10731911251350537;,citation_issn=1073-1911, 1552-3489;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Assessment;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Look under the Hood: Analyzing Engagement and Usage Data of a Smartphone-Based Intervention;,citation_abstract=Background Engagement with smartphone-based interventions stimulates adherence and improves the likelihood of gaining benefits from intervention content. Research often relies on system usage data to capture engagement. However, to what extent usage data reflect engagement is still an open empirical question. We studied how usage data relate to engagement, and how both relate to intervention outcomes. Methods We drew data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (N = 86) evaluating a smartphone-based inter-vention that aims to stimulate future self-identification (i.e., future self vividness, valence, relatedness). General app engagement and feature-specific engagement were retrospectively measured. Usage data (i.e., duration, number of logins, number of days used, exposure to intervention content) were unobtrusively registered. Results Engagement and usage data were not correlated. Multiple linear regression analyses revealed that gen-eral app engagement predicted future self vividness (p = .042) and relatedness (p = .004). Furthermore, engagement with several specific features also predicted aspects of future self-identification (p = .005 – .032). For usage data, the number of logins predicted future self vividness (p = .042) and exposure to intervention content predicted future self valence (p = .002). Conclusions Usage data did not reflect engagement and the latter was the better predictor of intervention out-comes. Thus, the relation between usage data and engagement is likely to be intervention-specific and the unquali-fied use of the former as an indicator of the latter may result in measurement error. We provide recommendations on how to capture engagement and app use in more valid ways.;,citation_author=Aniek M. Siezenga;,citation_author=Esther C. A.

VR and Smartphone Applications for Forensic Psychology;,citation_abstract=Over the past decade innovative technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and smartphone applications (apps) have demonstrated their potential for increasing well-being in various fields, such as (mental) health care and education. Although still in its infancy, the application of such technologies for treatment purposes in the forensic context and criminal justice practice is nascent. This chapter reviews the literature and describes the state-of-the-art of VR and apps in the forensic domain to explore the shared and unique possibilities for risk assessment, offender rehabilitation, and reintegration. In total, 18 VR applications and 18 smartphone apps were located in scientific databases and through web search. Aside from a review, we present a prospective vision of the unique treatment potential of VR and apps, as well as their complementary use. We conclude with limitations and ethical considerations.;,citation_author=Aniek M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Many Analysts, One Data Set: Making Transparent How Variations in Analytic Choices Affect Results;,citation_abstract=Twenty-nine teams involving 61 analysts used the same data set to address the same research question: whether soccer referees are more likely to give red cards to dark-skin-toned players than to light-skin-toned players. Analytic approaches varied widely across the teams, and the estimated effect sizes ranged from 0.89 to 2.93 (Mdn = 1.31) in odds-ratio units. Twenty teams (69%) found a statistically significant positive effect, and 9 teams (31%) did not observe a significant relationship. Overall, the 29 different analyses used 21 unique combinations of covariates. Neither analysts’ prior beliefs about the effect of interest nor their level of expertise readily explained the variation in the outcomes of the analyses. Peer ratings of the quality of the analyses also did not account for the variability. These findings suggest that significant variation in the results of analyses of complex data may be difficult to avoid, even by experts with honest intentions. Crowdsourcing data analysis, a strategy in which numerous research teams are recruited to simultaneously investigate the same research question, makes transparent how defensible, yet subjective, analytic choices influence research results.;,citation_author=R.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Effectiveness of Motivational Interviewing with Justice-involved People: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis;,citation_abstract=Objective: Motivational interviewing (MI) is increasingly recognized as an effective approach in forensic settings, particularly for overcoming resistance by avoiding confrontation and fostering intrinsic motivation. Research shows that interventions incorporating MI are more effective than other approaches in preventing and reducing offending behavior, highlighting its importance in improving intervention outcomes. Given this evidence, advocating for the integration of MI is crucial to enhance the effectiveness of interventions. Method: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to systematize knowledge and assess the effectiveness of interventions incorporating MI for justice-involved people who have been sentenced to custodial or non-custodial measures. Twenty-two studies were included. The total sample size of the studies ranged from 25 to 528 individuals convicted of various offences, including intimate partner violence, violent crimes, sexual offences, property crimes, driving offences, and drug offences. Results: Results indicated that MI is more effective in increasing session attendance and reducing dropout than interventions without MI. For official recidivism, evidence favored MI with a statistically significant reduction in recidivism rates. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of integrating MI into forensic settings, establishing its positive impact on numerous outcomes.;,citation_author=Teresa Pinto E Silva;,citation_author=Cláudia Gouveia;,citation_author=Faraj A.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Impact of Immersion on the Perception of Pornography: A Virtual Reality Study;,citation_abstract=The present study investigated the effects of varying degrees of immersion on the perception of pornographic video material. Concretely, we compared conventional desktop with Virtual Reality (VR) technology, with the latter embedding the observer in a virtual environment. Differences in the participant’s reaction and evaluation between both display modes were explored. Sixty male participants were alternately shown sexually explicit video material on a two-dimensional desktop monitor and a three-dimensional, high-immersive VR headmounted display (HMD). During the two video sequences, physical arousal was continuously measured as skin conductance response, whereas subjective sexual arousal was measured using a slider. Questionnaire measures of subjective sexual arousal, presence, and sexual presence were also employed. Results showed that viewing pornographic video material via VR technology had a stronger effect on psychophysiological reactions as well as subjective experience than using the conventional desktop display. It thus appears that experiencing pornographic video stimuli in high-immersive virtual environments increases the experience of presence as well as sexual-related perception.;,citation_author=Sofia C.

Ninety-seven heterosexual men were randomized to 1 of 6 independent conditions in a 2 (high arousal or control)  3 (alcohol target BAC = 0.08), placebo, or juice control) design and then completed a variant of the Approach Avoidance Task (AAT). The AAT assessed reaction times toward approaching and avoiding erotic stimuli and condoms with a joystick. Consistent with hypotheses, the alcohol condition exhibited an approach bias toward erotic stimuli, whereas the control and placebo groups exhibited an approach bias toward condom stimuli. Similarly, the participants in the high arousal condition exhibited an approach bias toward erotic stimuli and the low arousal control condition exhibited an approach bias toward condoms. The results suggest that acute changes in intoxication and physiological arousal independently foster biased responding towards sexual stimuli and these biases are associated with sexual risk intentions.;,citation_author=Jeffrey S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Robust Statistical Methods and the Credibility Movement of Psychological Science;,citation_abstract=The general linear model (GLM) is the most frequently applied family of statistical models in psychology. Within the GLM, the effects under study are estimated using the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation, which produces unbiased and optimal parameter estimates, and unbiased null hypothesis significance tests when (1) outliers and influential cases are absent, and (2) assumptions of linearity and additivity, spherical errors, and normal errors are met. This paper first provides a technical description of OLS and an overview of its statistical assumptions. We then discuss the methods commonly employed to detect and address violations of assumptions, and how the current application of these methods can compromise the reproducibility of findings by allowing too much flexibility in the analytic process. We briefly introduce several robust estimation methods - namely bootstrapping, heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors, M -estimators, and trimming - that can improve the accuracy of parameter estimates and the power of statistical tests. We provide guidance on how these methods can be used to transparently preregister a sensitivity analysis, reducing the opportunity for problematic researcher degrees of freedom to enter the analytic pipeline.;,citation_author=Martina Sladekova;,citation_author=Andy Peter Field;,citation_publication_date=2024-06;,citation_cover_date=2024-06;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.31234/osf.io/8ydc6;,citation_language=en-US;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Multidisciplinary Approach to Understanding the Technology, Opportunities, Challenges, and Implications for Society of the Metaverse;,citation_abstract=Since late 2021, there has been increasing interest in the idea of the “metaverse.” This is a virtual, augmented or mixed reality system that potentially millions of people can simultaneously inhabit and where people can interact with one another in real-time, irrespective of the physical distance between them. It is heralded by some as the next-level world wide web that will use a 3D immersive interface, with the potential of mixing virtual and physical reality, with environments persisting over time and all interoperable between different platforms and devices. Nevertheless, there is still no true example of a metaverse, only a number of nascent examples. Here we discuss the technical foundations for such metaverses, the role of generative AI, and its possible impact on society—including education, healthcare and quality of life, business and consumers, the future of work, and its implications for democracy. We also discuss public perceptions of the metaverse, issues of governance and regulation, and its legal implications. Overall, while the metaverse may radically and positively alter the way that we live, we must take into account ethical and regulatory issues in order to avoid predictions of a dystopian future being realized. This study is, therefore, a multi-disciplinary introduction to the metaverse concept that may be useful to readers with many different interests.;,citation_author=Mel Slater;,citation_author=Michele Di Dalmazi;,citation_author=Doron Friedman;,citation_author=Jessica Galissaire;,citation_author=Henri Isaac;,citation_author=Anna Kobusinska;,citation_author=Aurelio Lopez-Tarruella-Martinez;,citation_author=Lucio Lamberti;,citation_author=Jean-François Lucas;,citation_author=Omar Aziz Niamut;,citation_author=Xueni Pan;,citation_author=Yannick Prié;,citation_author=Matthias Quent;,citation_author=Raul Ruiz Rodríguez;,citation_author=Maria V.

The current study examined the effects of this training in a randomized controlled trial among forensic psychiatric outpatients with aggression regulation problems (N = 30). In addition to the aggression replacement training, patients played either the VR-GAIME or a control game. Aggressive behavior was measured pre-, half-way, and post-treatment via self-report and clinicians ratings. No difference was found between the VR-GAIME and the control game. However, the participants reported gaining more insight into their own behavior and that of others.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Symptoms of Cybersex Addiction Can Be Linked to Both Approaching and Avoiding Pornographic Stimuli: Results from an Analog Sample of Regular Cybersex Users;,citation_abstract=There is no consensus regarding the phenomenology, classification, and diagnostic criteria of cybersex addiction. Some approaches point toward similarities to substance dependencies for which approach/avoidance tendencies are crucial mechanisms. Several researchers have argued that within an addiction-related decision situation, individuals might either show tendencies to approach or avoid addiction-related stimuli. In the current study 123 heterosexual males completed an Approach-AvoidanceTask (AAT; Rinck and Becker, 2007) modified with pornographic pictures. During the AAT participants either had to push pornographic stimuli away or pull them toward themselves with a joystick. Sensitivity toward sexual excitation, problematic sexual behavior, and tendencies toward cybersex addiction were assessed with questionnaires. Results showed that individuals with tendencies toward cybersex addiction tended to either approach or avoid pornographic stimuli. Additionally, moderated regression analyses revealed that individuals with high sexual excitation and problematic sexual behavior who showed high approach/avoidance tendencies, reported higher symptoms of cybersex addiction. Analogous to substance dependencies, results suggest that both approach and avoidance tendencies might play a role in cybersex addiction. Moreover, an interaction with sensitivity toward sexual excitation and problematic sexual behavior could have an accumulating effect on the severity of subjective complaints in everyday life due to cybersex use. The findings provide further empirical evidence for similarities between cybersex addiction and substance dependencies. Such similarities could be retraced to a comparable neural processing of cybersex- and drug-related cues.;,citation_author=Jan Snagowski;,citation_author=Matthias Brand;,citation_publication_date=2015-05;,citation_cover_date=2015-05;,citation_year=2015;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00653;,citation_issn=1664-1078;,citation_volume=6;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychology;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Automatic Direction of Spatial Attention to Male Versus Female Stimuli: A Comparison of Heterosexual Men and Women;,citation_abstract=Abundant research has shown that men’s sexual attractions are more category-specific in relation to gender than women’s are. We tested whether the early automatic allocation of spatial attention reflects these sexual attractions. The dot-probe taskwas used to assess whether spatial attentionwas attracted to images of either male or female models that were naked or partially clothed. In Experiment 1, men were faster if the target appeared after the female stimulus, whereas women were equally quick to respond to targets after male or female stimuli. In Experiment 2, neutral cues were introduced. Men were again faster to female images in comparison to male or neutral images, but showed no bias on the male versus neutral test. Women were faster to both male and female pictures in comparison to neutral pictures. However, in this experiment they were also faster to female pictures than to male pictures. The results suggest that early attentional processes reveal category-specific interest to the preferred sexual category for heterosexual men, and suggest that heterosexual women do not have category-specific guidance of attentional mechanisms. The technique may have promise in measuring sexual interest in other situations where participants may not be able, or may not be willing, to report upon their sexual interests (e.g., assessment of paedophilic interest).;,citation_author=Robert J.

Independent variables included demographic characteristics, offense type, drug involvement, various neighborhood variables (e.g., concentrated disadvantage, residential mobility), and spatial contagion (i.e., proximity to others who become reincarcerated). Using geographic information systems (GIS) and logistic regression modeling, our results showed that the likelihood of reincarceration was increased with male gender, drug involvement, offense type, and living in areas with high rates of recidivism. Older offenders and those convicted of violent or drug offenses were less likely to be reincarcerated. For violent offenders, drug involvement, age, and spatial contagion were particular risk factors for reincarceration.

One of the most prominent questionable research practices is p -hacking. Typically, p -hacking is defined as a compound of strategies targeted at rendering non-significant hypothesis testing results significant. However, a comprehensive overview of these p -hacking strategies is missing, and current meta-scientific research often ignores the heterogeneity of strategies. Here, we compile a list of 12 p -hacking strategies based on an extensive literature review, identify factors that control their level of severity, and demonstrate their impact on false-positive rates using simulation studies. We also use our simulation results to evaluate several approaches that have been proposed to mitigate the influence of questionable research practices. Our results show that investigating p -hacking at the level of strategies can provide a better understanding of the process of p -hacking, as well as a broader basis for developing effective countermeasures. By making our analyses available through a Shiny app and R package, we facilitate future meta-scientific research aimed at investigating the ramifications of p -hacking across multiple strategies, and we hope to start a broader discussion about different manifestations of p -hacking in practice.;,citation_author=Angelika M.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Media Coverage of Pedophilia and Its Impact on Help-Seeking Persons with Pedophilia in Germany—A Focus Group Study;,citation_abstract=The public stigma associated with pedophilia, the sexual attraction to prepubescent children, is tremendous. Previous research indicates that undifferentiated media coverage plays an essential role in perpetuating the public stigma by falsely equating pedophilia and child sexual abuse (CSA) and thus may stop persons suffering from a pedophilic disorder from seeking professional help. Until now, a comprehensive examination of positive as well as negative media effects on affected individuals is missing. Therefore, the present study explores if and how media coverage impacts the lives of help-seeking persons with pedophilia by conducting four qualitative focus group discussions with a clinical sample (N = 20) from the German Prevention Network “Kein Täter werden”. Present results demonstrate that media coverage of pedophilia was perceived as mostly undifferentiated, even though participants observed an increase in fact-based reporting over the years. Moreover, it seems that media coverage has strong emotional and behavioral consequences for patients (e.g., negative reporting reduced self-esteem). In sum, our results highlight that differentiated media coverage could play a key role in supporting help-seeking persons with pedophilic disorder, while the impact of undifferentiated media coverage appears to be mostly negative. Therefore, our results point to the need to reframe pedophilia using differentiated media coverage to help affected persons receive treatment efficiently and thereby prevent CSA.;,citation_author=Daniela Stelzmann;,citation_author=Sara Jahnke;,citation_author=Laura Kuhle;,citation_publication_date=2022-07;,citation_cover_date=2022-07;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.3390/ijerph19159356;,citation_volume=19;,citation_journal_title=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A Review of Childhood Sexual Abuse Perpetration Prevention Programs;,citation_abstract=Purpose of Review The present review examines existing childhood sexual abuse prevention programs that are focused on providing services to individuals who are at risk of perpetration. We describe several perpetrator-oriented prevention programs with evaluation data as well as avenues for future development and research. Recent Findings Perpetration prevention programs can be divided into anonymous and non-anonymous programs. Anonymous programs include those that provide support via helplines and those that provide self-guided digital interventions. Non-anonymous programs provide traditional psychotherapy. There are several prevention programs with limited evaluation data, but no research to date has aggregated these findings and provided a comprehensive assessment of perpetration prevention. Summary There is insufficient evidence to determine whether perpetration prevention programs are effective. More rigorous evaluations of secondary prevention programs are needed. Despite this, early data suggests that perpetration prevention programs are promising.;,citation_author=Skye Stephens;,citation_author=Desiree Elchuk;,citation_author=Myles Davidson;,citation_author=Samantha Williams;,citation_publication_date=2022-10;,citation_cover_date=2022-10;,citation_year=2022;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11920-022-01375-8;,citation_journal_title=Current Psychiatry Reports;">

Vier Studien werden beschrieben, in denen eine neue Skala im Stil der Crowne-Marlowe-Skala entwickelt und überprüft wird. Das Ergebnis ist die Soziale-Erwünschtheits-Skala-17 (SES-17). Diese umfaßt 17 Items. Reliabilität und konvergente Validität sind zufriedenstellend: Die interne Konsistenz liegt bei .72 bis .75, die Retest-Stabilität über vier Wochen bei .82 und die Korrelation mit der SDS-CM bei .67 bis .74. Damit ist die SES-17 ein der SDS-CM vergleichbares Verfahren, ist jedoch ökonomischer (17 statt 23 Items) und zeigt höhere Augenscheinvalidität: Eine Stichprobe von 49 Beurteilern schätzte die Items beider Skalen bezüglich sozialer Erwünschtheit ein.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Hypothalamic Volume in Pedophilia with or without Child Sexual Offense;,citation_abstract=The hypothalamus regulates sexual behavior and is simultaneously associated with aggression and violence. Consequently, this brain region is relevant in research of pedophilia and child sexual offenses (CSO). The distinction between these two phenomena is of great importance and was the object of consideration of this study. We analyzed exclusively men, including 73 pedophilic offenders who committed CSO, an equal number of people with pedophilia but without such offenses, and 133 non-pedophilic, non-offending subjects who formed the control group. All data were collected in a multicenter in vivo study and analyzed using a semi-automated segmentation algorithm for 3-Tesla magnetic resonance images. Men with pedophilia who committed CSO on average had a 47 mm3 smaller hypothalamus per side than people without committed CSO. This effect was driven by both the group of non-offending people with pedophilia and the control group. By contrast, the exploratory comparison of pedophilic persons without CSO with the control group showed no significant difference. The present study demonstrates a deviant hypothalamic structure as a neurobiological correlate of CSO in pedophiles, but not in people with pedophilia who have not committed CSO. Thus, it strengthens the argument to distinguish between sexual offending and paraphilic sexual preferences.;,citation_author=Melanie Storch;,citation_author=Maria Kanthack;,citation_author=Till Amelung;,citation_author=Klaus M.

The present research investigated whether the mere “belief” that the virtual avatar is computer or human operated forms a crucial factor for eliciting physiological cues to deception. Participants were interviewed about a transgression they had been seduced to commit, by a human-like virtual avatar. In a between-subject design, participants either deceived or told the truth about this transgression. During the interviews, we measured the physiological responses assessing participants’ electrodermal activity (EDA). In line with our hypothesis, EDA differences between deceivers and truth tellers only were significant for participants who believed they interacted with a human operated (compared to a computer operated) avatar.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Immersive Virtual Reality Simulation in Forensic Psychiatry and Adjacent Clinical Fields: A Review of Current Assessment and Treatment Methods for Practitioners;,citation_abstract=Background: Research has indicated that interactive, computerized case simulations using immersive virtual reality (VR) technology may be beneficial in the augmentation of conventional methods of assessment and treatment in forensic psychiatry, primarily through providing an engaging and safe environment in which the user can practice and learn skills and behaviors. However, there does not appear to be an overview of current developments available in the field, which may be an obstacle to clinicians considering the use of VR in their clinical practice. Objectives: Current, clinically relevant assessment and treatment methods applying immersive VR in forensic or adjacent clinical settings, were analyzed. Methods: This review surveyed the practical use of immersive VR in forensic psychiatry and relevant adjacent psychiatric and forensic fields from 2016 to 2020 and was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: Out of the 1,105 journal articles screened, 14 met criteria for inclusion. Four articles described VR interventions directly addressing forensic psychiatric settings (treatment of general aggression and assessment of sexual offenders against children). The majority of the remaining articles were in the clinical domain of psychosis treatment. Several interventions were designed as part of comprehensive treatment programs, and others were intended as one-off assessments or paired with pre-existing psychological treatment. The degree to which the VR simulations were individualized to the user appeared to be largely dependent upon the extent of provider input. A variety of research methodologies were used in the included articles and the majority had limitations common to small-scale, non-randomized studies. None of the studies reported serious adverse effects. Discussion: There is a lack of large randomized controlled trials of current assessments or treatments using VR simulation in forensic psychiatry, let alone those with long-term follow-up, showing clear advantages of VR over standard practice. The evidence thus far is insufficient to recommend immediate and large-scale implementation of any one VR intervention, however, several have been shown to be feasible and acceptable to the participants and to provide insights and inspiration for future research and development.;,citation_author=Kristina Sygel;,citation_author=Märta Wallinius;,citation_publication_date=2021-05;,citation_cover_date=2021-05;,citation_year=2021;,citation_doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2021.673089;,citation_issn=1664-0640;,citation_volume=12;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Psychiatry;">

A predominant view within the literature is that cognitive distortions are cognitive products that arise from deeper cognitive structures, although it has also been proposed that goals and situational factors can play a role. In this article, we provide an updated theoretical account of cognitive distortions in males – the Multi-Mechanism Theory of Cognitive Distortions (MMT-CD). Adopting a dual-process perspective, and incorporating the concept of motivated cognition and the effects of visceral factors, we propose that cognitive distortions arise from three mechanisms, which can be identified in terms of their temporal occurrence to an offense. Mechanism I accounts for cognitive distortions that arise long before an offense is committed but serve to influence an individual’s life-course and goals in a way that brings them closer eventually sexually offending. Mechanism II accounts for distortions that arise in the lead up to or immediately before a sexual offense, thus, providing a justification for committing an offense. Mechanism III accounts for distortions that are formed postoffense as a result of the adversarial context of the individual’s social environment. We describe: (1) the nature of each mechanism; (2) the way they underpin particular distortions; (3) the role they play in the etiology of sex offending; (4) and how they may play out in research and practice.;,citation_author=Filip Szumski;,citation_author=Ross M.

This review examines research on social desirability in both forensic and nonforensic populations with the goal of identifying how best to minimize threats to the validity of research with sexual offenders. Although social desirability has long been a major research topic in personality, consensus has not been reached on key questions such as its dimensional structure and whether social desirability constitutes a trait or a response bias. Research with offenders has shown that social desirability is negatively related to recidivism and that different offender subtypes vary in the degree to which social desirability appears to influence self-reports, with child molesters exhibiting the strongest tendency to “fake good.” Several methods of controlling for social desirability have been proposed, but the effectiveness of these methods in increasing validity of offender self reports is questionable. Given the lack of consensus in the personality literature, a fresh start is needed in which basic questions regarding social desirability are revisited with respect to offender populations.;,citation_author=Lavinia Tan;,citation_author=Randolph C.

However, with the increasing use of neuroimaging techniques, such as functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI, fMRI), together with neuropsychological studies, we are increasing our knowledge of predisposing and accompanying factors contributing to pedophilia development. At the same time, we are faced with methodological challenges, such as group differences between studies, including age, intelligence, and comorbidities, together with a lack of careful assessment and control of child sexual abuse. Having this in mind, this review highlights the most important studies investigating pedophilia, with a strong emphasis on (neuro-) biological studies, combined with a brief explanation of research into normal human sexuality. We focus on some of the recent theories on the etiology of pedophilia such as the concept of a general neurodevelopmental disorder and/or alterations of structure and function in frontal, temporal, and limbic brain areas.

This paper assessed the instrument’s ability to assess relative risk for these outcomes in a sample of over 300 Austrian adult males serving a prison sentence for a sexual offense for whom 5-year rates of sexual and violent recidivism were available. Results indicated an ability to assess relative risk that was comparable to that observed in the United Kingdom. In the context of previous results from Germany, the findings of the present study indicate that Risk Matrix 2000 may be appropriately applied in Europe.

We examine research into the assessment of protective factors to see whether it can play this role relative to sexual offending. Structured asses sment of protective factors is well developed relative to violent offending but only recently studied relative to sexual offending. Nevertheless, multiple measures of protective factors have now been trialed with men who have committed sexual offenses and shown to predict reduced recidivism. Although research into individual scales is limited, overlapping content between scales suggests that protective factors aligning with constructs of Resilience, Adaptive Sexuality, and Prosocial Connection and Reward are all relevant to sexual offending. Protective factors relevant to sexual offending are sufficiently well identified that they can usefully be used for treatment need assessment, treatment planning during therapy, and case management. They can also make some contribution to risk assessment. The Structured Assessment of PROtective Factors against Sexual Offending (SAPROF-SO) is currently the most comprehensive measure of protective factors relevant to sexual offending.;,citation_author=David Thornton;,citation_author=Gwenda Willis;,citation_author=Sharon Kelley;,citation_publication_date=2024-02;,citation_cover_date=2024-02;,citation_year=2024;,citation_doi=10.1007/s11920-024-01493-5;,citation_volume=26;,citation_journal_title=Current Psychiatry Reports;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Roles of Empathy and Theory of Mind in Sexual Violence Perpetration: An Integrated Social Information Processing Framework;,citation_abstract=Empathy is an aspect of social cognition which has gained much attention to explain sexual violence perpetration, with research resulting in mixed and contradictory findings. Another aspect of social cognition, which has been linked to, and even used synonymously with, cognitive empathy is Theory of Mind (ToM). However, research is severely lacking on the role which ToM may play in sexual violence. Hence, in order to elucidate such issues, following a theoretical discussion of these concepts, we propose an integrated Social Information Processing (SIP) framework to understand how empathy and ToM may be involved in sexual violence perpetration. This framework includes the steps laid out by Crick and Dodge’s original SIP model, the emotional processes emphasised by Lemerise and Arsenio, the empathy stages identified by Marshall and colleagues, and our propositions concerning the role played by ToM. In this theoretical article, we argue that ToM and empathy are primarily involved in earlier SIP stages, but may have repercussions on subsequent stages as SIP is cyclical. Nonetheless, greater research is needed to conclusively identify where deficits lie. In terms of clinical implications, we recommend that empathy and ToM be targeted in interventions (primary, secondary and tertiary) using cognitive-behavioural therapy principles which are involved in, and affect, SIP.;,citation_author=Sarah Tibbels;,citation_author=Massil Benbouriche;,citation_publication_date=2025-01;,citation_cover_date=2025-01;,citation_year=2025;,citation_doi=10.1177/10790632251315174;,citation_issn=1079-0632, 1573-286X;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Sexual Abuse;">

Accurately recognizing emo tions enables the inference of mental and affective states supporting social adaptation. As little attention has been paid to affective prosody recognition in forensic inpatients who have committed sexual offenses (FICSOs), this study assessed the accuracy and sensitivity scores of 111 male participants assigned into three groups: FICSOs (n = 35), forensic inpatients who have committed non-sexual offenses (FICNSOs, n = 26) and community members (CoM, n = 50). Collected data also include response bias, emotion labeling reflection time, task easiness and task easiness reflection time. Using non-parametric group com parisons (Kruskal–Wallis H and Mann–Whitney U), results highlight, overall, a pervasive impairment of affective prosody recognition in FICSOs and FICNSOs compared to CoM. However, there was no difference in disgust sensi tivity scores between FICSOs and CoM. FICSOs and FICNSOs took significantly longer than CoM to select an emotional label, especially for happiness. In addition, a metacognitive impairment was found in FICSOs and FICNSOs as they found the task significantly easier than CoM while being less sensitive.;,citation_author=Luca Adolfo Tiberi;,citation_author=Véronique Delvaux;,citation_author=Xavier Saloppé;,citation_author=Audrey Vicenzutto;,citation_author=Thierry H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Protocol for the CONNECT Study: A National Database and Prospective Follow-Up Study of Forensic Mental Health Patients in Germany;,citation_abstract=In Germany, the most frequently used legal section to order forensic mental health treatment is § 63 of the Penal Code (Strafgesetzbuch; StGB). This disposition is primarily aimed at individuals with major mental illnesses who are not fully responsible for a criminal act they committed. Despite evaluation and follow-up studies being conducted within individual hospitals or federal states we lack key epidemiological data on this patient group across the whole country. The present study aims to fill this gap by conducting an annual survey of all eligible forensic mental health hospitals to develop a database of basic clinical, legal and demographic data. Staff at participating hospitals will complete an online survey answering questions about individual patients using routinely collected hospital records. Over the duration of the study, eight-and-a-half years, we aim to collect data on approximately N = 6,450 patients. Alongside important clinical data, we will use official reconviction data at 3- and 6-year follow-ups to investigate the number and types of crimes committed by discharged patients. We aim to extend the scientific literature on factors associated with reconviction in the Risk-Needs-Responsivity model by also measuring the extent to which treatment engagement and programme completion during care predicts reconviction.

We investigated self-report data from 23 German women from the general population who reported a sexual interest in children and previous acts of CSA. Results showed that participants were mostly well-educated with almost no reported childhood maltreatment. At first offence, participants were 25.22 years and children (65.2% female) were 5.30 years on average. 95.5% of participants were known or related to the child and all of them conducted at least one contact sexual offense. 87% stated they conducted the sexual acts for “sexual satisfaction”; 34.8% out of “love”; 30.4% for “physical closeness”; and 34.8% for “emotional closeness”. The results indicate that participants conduct the offence voluntarily and were not coerced by anyone else to engage in CSA.

Methods A systematic literature search was conducted to document current legal policies across 26 different countries. Additionally, a questionnaire assessing the practice of pharmacological treatment was sent to practitioners involved in the treatment of patients with paraphilic disorders. Results Legal policies concerning the preconditions of using pharmacological treatments differ considerably between countries and for most jurisdictions do not exist. Drawing on the responses of 178 practitioners, pharmacological agents are a useful addition to psychotherapeutic interventions, especially with those patients classified as medium to high risk for sexually violent behaviours. It would appear that most patients are medically examined, are informed of the risks and possible side effects before treatment commences and are also obliged to sign a consent form. Conclusions Although pharmacological agents can be seen as an intrusion into a patients’ sexual selfdetermination, results indicate that ethical and clinical standards are being met in the majority of cases.

Methods: An extensive literature search was conducted using the English-language-literature indexed on PubMed and Google Scholar without time limit, supplemented by other sources, including published reviews. Results: Each treatment recommendation was evaluated with respect to the strength of evidence for its efficacy, safety, tolerability, and feasibility. Psychoeducation and psychotherapy are first-choice treatments and should always be conducted. The type of medication recommended depended mainly on the intensity of CSBD and comorbid sexual and psychiatric disorders. There are few randomised controlled trials. Although no medications carry formal indications for CSBD, selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors and naltrexone currently constitute the most relevant pharmacological treatments for the treatment of CSBD. In cases of CSBD with comorbid paraphilic disorders, hormonal agents may be indicated, and one should refer to previously published guidelines on the treatment of adults with paraphilic disorders. Specific recommendations are also proposed in case of chemsex behaviour associated with CSBD.

Results showed that, for Het men (but not Het women) and Non-Het women (but not Non-Het men), baseline T was significantly lower in partnered than unpartnered individuals. Longitudinal analyses indicated that changes in partnered status were not associated with changes in testosterone concentrations; instead, women and men with lower T at baseline were significantly more likely to be partnered at follow-up. These findings thus suggest that partnered status is associated with stable, trait-level T values, rather than current state. Furthermore, the observed effect is limited to individuals (male or female) who are oriented toward female partners.

During the interaction, they reflected on their current lifestyle, alternating between the perspective of their present self and that of their future self. We hypothesized that this embodied experience would increase their ability to imagine themselves in the future and reduce their engagement in self-defeating behavior, as measured with a self-report survey. In line with expectations, results indicated that the interaction increased vividness of the future self compared to baseline and reduced self-defeating behavior, including alcohol use and overspending, one week later. In addition, increases in vividness were associated with a reduction in self-defeating behavior over and above other concepts relating to the future self, including connectedness, similarity, and valence. The results are based on a small sample and should therefore be considered as indicative of the possibilities of our virtual reality paradigm as an intervention tool to reduce self-defeating behavior.;,citation_author=Jean-Louis Van Gelder;,citation_author=Liza J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Testosterone Shifts the Balance between Sensitivity for Punishment and Reward in Healthy Young Women;,citation_abstract=Animal research has demonstrated reductions in punishment sensitivity and enhanced reward dependency after testosterone administration. In humans, elevated levels of testosterone have been associated with violent and antisocial behavior. Interestingly, extreme forms of violent and antisocial behavior can be observed in the psychopath. Moreover, it has been argued that reduced punishment sensitivity and heightened reward dependency are crucially involved in the etiology and maintenance of psychopathy. A task that has been proven to be capable of simulating punishment–reward contingencies is the IOWA gambling task. Decisions to choose from decks of cards become motivated by punishment and reward schedules inherent in the task. Importantly, clinical and subclinical psychopaths demonstrate a risky, disadvantageous pattern of decision-making in the task, indicating motivational imbalance (insensitivity for punishment and enhanced reward dependency). Here, in a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover design (n $\frac{1}{4}$ 12), whether a single administration of testosterone would shift the motivational balance between the sensitivity for punishment and reward towards this tendency to choose disadvantageously was investigated. As hypothesized, subjects showed a more disadvantageous pattern of decision-making after testosterone compared to placebo administration. These findings not only provide the first direct evidence for the effects of testosterone on punishment–reward contingencies in humans, but they also give further insights into the hypothetical link between testosterone and psychopathy.;,citation_author=Jack Honk;,citation_author=Dennis J.

Sixteen sexually functional heterosexual males rated 150 computer screen pictures, selected from the International Affective Picture System, representing five stimulus types differing along dimensions of emotional valence and arousal, and erotic vs. non-erotic content. A positive deflection of the ERP between 300 and 500 ms after stimulus onset (P300) was found to be sensitive to stimulus differences, with positive valence and high arousal resulting in larger P300. Furthermore, the positive slow wave (PSW) between 500 and 750 ms revealed additive effects of valence and arousal value. High arousal and positive valence of the stimuli resulted in larger PSW. Importantly, an interaction effect was absent here. In addition, sexual content led to a larger P300 and PSW than expected on the basis of a mere additive contribution of high arousal and positive valence.;,citation_author=Jacques J. D. M.

Based on a paramorphic human judgment model, the present study investigates possible determinants of accuracy and bias in age estimation across the adult life span. For this purpose, 154 young, middle-aged, and older participants of both genders estimated the age of 171 faces of young, middle-aged, and older men and women, portrayed on a total of 2,052 photographs. Each face displayed either an angry, fearful, disgusted, happy, sad, or neutral expression (FACES database; Ebner, Riediger, &amp;amp;amp; Lindenberger, 2010). We found that age estimation ability decreased with age. Older and young adults, however, were more accurate and less biased in estimating the age of members of their own as compared with those of the other age group. In contrast, no reliable own-gender advantage was observed. Generally, the age of older faces was more difficult to estimate than the age of younger faces. Furthermore, facial expressions had a substantial impact on accuracy and bias of age estimation. Relative to other facial expressions, the age of neutral faces was estimated most accurately, while the age of faces displaying happy expressions was most likely underestimated.

To date, however, implementing such environments in experimental settings with traditional research methods (e. g., case vignettes) has proved challenging for ethical or practical reasons. Using existing findings and the successful application of VR in the area of (sexual) victimization, the authors propose applying VR for the empirical validation of credibility assessment methods, in particular, criteria-based content analysis (CBCA). Against the background of previous heterogeneous findings regarding the validity and reliability of CBCA, the authors discuss the benefits of using VR to overcome the challenges of traditional research designs regarding ethical dilemmas as well as internal and external validity regarding ethical challenges when implementing VR in contexts of (sexual) victimization. The authors argue in favor of using VR to validate credibility assessment methods since transparent and replicable conclusions are crucial in credibility assessment evaluations.;,citation_author=Theres Volz;,citation_author=Silvia Gubi-Kelm;,citation_author=Judith A.

We provide an overview of the literature comparing group therapy with individual treatment and summarise the main advantages and disadvantages of both treatment modalities. Group treatment appears to be at least as effective as individual treatment, and there are several clinical advantages obtained through group processes which helpfully address the particular criminogenic needs of the sexual offender population and which are less easily obtained in individual therapy. In addition, we also address the debate about the advantages of open-ended versus closed-group formats. Open-ended groups seem to offer more clinical advantages than closed groups, and in particular allow for treatment to be more responsive to individual needs, although there have been no direct comparisons of the two approaches with sexual offenders.

These base rates are pertinent information for assessing the recidivism risk of offenders. They provide a foundation for clinical assessment and an empirical basis for risk assessment instrument norms, which inform expected recidivism rates. The present study explored the extent to which base rates influence the validity of risk assessment instruments. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the available evidence on the discrimination ability of four well-established risk assessment instruments used to estimate the probability of recidivism for general (Level of Service InventoryRevised [LSI-R]), violent (Violence Risk Appraisal Guide [VRAG]), sexual (Static-99R), and intimate partner violent offences (Ontario Domestic Assault Risk Assessment [ODARA]). We conducted a bivariate logit-normal random effects meta-analysis of sensitivity and false positive rates and modelled the positive and negative predictive values. We used base rates as reported in (a) the construction samples of each risk assessment instrument and (b) recent official statistics and peer-reviewed articles for different offence categories and countries.

Many inmates report having felt provoked or threatened by their victims, which might be due to a tendency to ascribe malicious intentions when faced with ambiguous social signals, termed hostile attribution bias. Methods: The present study presented morphed fear-anger faces to prison inmates with a history of violent crimes, a history of child sexual abuse, and to matched controls form the general population. Participants performed a fear-anger decision task. Analyses compared both response frequencies and measures derived from psychophysical functions fitted to the data. In addition, a test to distinguish basic facial expressions and questionnaires for aggression, psychopathy and personality disorders were administered. Results: Violent offenders present with a reliable hostile attribution bias, in that they rate ambiguous fear-anger expressions as more angry, compared to both the control population and perpetrators of child sexual abuse. Psychometric functions show a lowered threshold to detect anger in violent offenders compared to the general population. This effect is especially pronounced for male faces, correlates with self-reported aggression and presents in absence of a general emotion recognition impairment. Conclusions: The results indicate that a hostile attribution, related to individual level of aggression and pronounced for male faces, might be one mechanism mediating physical violence.;,citation_author=Martin Wegrzyn;,citation_author=Sina Westphal;,citation_author=Johanna Kissler;,citation_publication_date=2017-12;,citation_cover_date=2017-12;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1186/s40359-017-0186-z;,citation_issn=2050-7283;,citation_volume=5;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=BMC Psychology;">

We applied the Approach–Avoidance Task (AAT) for detecting sexual interests in 38 pedophilic men (18 primarily attracted to boys) and 27 male nonpedophilic (11 gay) participants. The AAT relies on automatic approach and avoidance tendencies, independent of cognitive abilities such as memory capacity and intelligence. Approach–avoidance tendencies toward stimuli depicting seminude prepubescent boys and girls as well as men and women are reported. The results were consistent with previous research on the utility of the AAT: Except for pedophiles attracted to girls, the mean AAT scores (approach minus avoidance reaction time for each stimulus category) were positive only for stimuli of the preferred category.

We examined the influence of sexual orientation on locomotor approach-avoidance behavior and interpersonal distance.

In the first experiment, subjects took a step forward (approach) or backward (avoidance) in response to the sex of the virtual person. We measured reaction time, peak velocity, and step size, and obtained ratings of sexual attractiveness in every trial. In the second experiment, subjects had to approach the virtual person as if they were to engage in a social interaction. Here, we analyzed interpersonal distance and peak velocity of the approaches. Our results suggest that sexual attraction facilitates the approach response and reduces the preferred interpersonal distance.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Test–Retest Reliability and Temporal Agreement of Direct and Indirect Sexual Interest Measures;,citation_abstract=The Explicit and Implicit Sexual Interest Profile (EISIP; Banse, Schmidt, &amp;amp;amp; Clarbour, 2010) is a multimethod measure of sexual interest in children and adults. It combines indirect latency-based measures such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT), Viewing Time (VT) and explicit selfreport measures. This study examined test-retest reliability and absolute temporal agreement of the EISIP over a two-week interval in persons who were convicted of sexual offences against children (n = 33) and non-offending controls (n = 48). Test-retest reliability of the aggregated EISIP measures was high across the whole sample (rtt = .90, ICC = .90) with the IAT yielding the lowest retest correlations (rtt = .66, ICC = .66). However, these indicators of relative reliability only quantify the temporal stability of individual differences within the group, not the detectability of individual change. Absolute temporal agreement as assessed via Bland-Altman plots ranged from one fourth to three thirds of a standardized unit in the sexual preference scores. This implies that individual change has to exceed medium to large standardized effect sizes to be distinguishable from spontaneous temporal variation in the EISIP measures. Overall, scores of combined measures were largely superior to single measures in terms of both absolute and relative reliability.;,citation_author=Robin Welsch;,citation_author=Alexander F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Neural Correlates of Subliminally Presented Visual Sexual Stimuli;,citation_abstract=In the context of forensic psychiatry, it is crucial that diagnoses of deviant sexual interests are resistant to manipulation. In a first attempt to promote the development of such tools, the current fMRI study focusses on the examination of hemodynamic responses to preferred, in contrast to non-preferred, sexual stimuli with and without explicit sexual features in 24 healthy heterosexual subjects. The subliminal stimulus presentation of sexual stimuli could be a new approach to reduce vulnerability to manipulation. Meaningful images and scrambled images were applied as masks. Recognition performance was low, but interestingly, sexual preference and explicitness modulated stimulus visibility, suggesting interactions between networks of sexual arousal and consciousness. With scrambled masks, higher activations for sexually preferred images and for explicit images were found in areas associated with sexual arousal (Stoleru, Fonteille, Cornelis, Joyal, &amp;amp;amp; Moulier, 2012). We conclude that masked sexual stimuli can evoke activations in areas associated with supraliminal induced sexual arousal.;,citation_author=Martina Wernicke;,citation_author=Corinna Hofter;,citation_author=Kirsten Jordan;,citation_author=Peter Fromberger;,citation_author=Peter Dechent;,citation_author=Jürgen L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Qualität und Qualitätssicherung in der strafrechtsrelevanten Begutachtungspraxis;,citation_abstract=Criminal risk and criminal responsibility assessment reports are of public and sociopolitical concern, not least due to their impact on explosive decisions, entailing serious consequences, such as offender sentencing or endangerment of victims. As the empirical literature points to a heterogeneous quality of these assessment reports in practice, measures regarding quality assurance, such as the publication of methodological minimum requirements for criminal risk and responsibility assessments were introduced. Recent studies of an iterative research project on the basis of more than 1000 retrospectively analyzed criminal risk and responsibility assessment reports provide empirical data about an increasing standardization and implementation of these standards in general practice. Nevertheless, the quality of reports still appears to be relatively heterogeneous. The study results demonstrate the positive impact of quality assurance measures on the quality of assessment reports, although such guidelines do not necessarily show timely effects across institutions. Furthermore, the requesting party and the comprehensiveness of the judicial orders may have an impact on the quality of assessments and as such, there is potential for improvement on their side as well. On the one hand, the results indicate a (partial) positive effect in terms of quality improvement but on the other hand more steps need to be taken to ensure high quality risk and responsibility assessment reports.;,citation_author=Maximilian Wertz;,citation_author=Martin Rettenberger;,citation_author=Hauke Brettel;,citation_language=de-DE;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Including All Individuals Is Not Enough: Lessons for Intention-to-Treat Analysis;,citation_abstract=Background—Intention-to-treat analysis requires all randomised individuals to be included in the analysis in the groups to which they were randomised. However, there is confusion about how intention-to-treat analysis should be performed in the presence of missing outcome data. Purpose—To explain, justify and illustrate an intention-to-treat analysis strategy for randomised trials with incomplete outcome data. Methods—We consider several methods of analysis and compare their underlying assumptions, plausibility, and numbers of individuals included. We illustrate the intention-to-treat analysis strategy using data from the UK700 trial in the management of severe mental illness. Results—Depending on the assumptions made about the missing data, some methods of analysis that include all randomised individuals may be less valid than methods that do not include all randomised individuals. Further, some methods of analysis that include all randomised individuals are essentially equivalent to methods that do not include all randomised individuals. Limitations—This work assumes that the aim of analysis is to obtain an accurate estimate of the difference in outcome between randomised groups, not to obtain a conservative estimate with bias against the experimental intervention. Conclusions—Clinical trials should employ an intention-to-treat analysis strategy, comprising a design that attempts to follow up all randomised individuals, a main analysis that is valid under a stated plausible assumption about the missing data, and sensitivity analyses which include all randomised individuals in order to explore the impact of departures from the assumption underlying the main analysis. Following this strategy recognises the extra uncertainty arising from missing outcomes and increases the incentive for researchers to minimise the extent of missing data.;,citation_author=Ian R White;,citation_author=James Carpenter;,citation_author=Nicholas J Horton;,citation_publication_date=2012-08;,citation_cover_date=2012-08;,citation_year=2012;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1177/1740774512450098;,citation_issn=1740-7745, 1740-7753;,citation_volume=9;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Clinical Trials;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Prevention of Sexual Child Abuse: Preliminary Results From an Outpatient Therapy Program;,citation_abstract=In Germany, access to outpatient treatment services devoted to the prevention of (further) sexual offenses against minors and child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) offenses is often limited. The therapy project “Prevention of Sexual Abuse” tries to fill this gap by providing treatment to patients with a self-reported sexual interest in children and adolescents, irrespective of whether or not they are pedophilic or prosecuted by the legal justice system. Within the project, a treatment manual was developed which specifically addresses dynamic risk-factors in child sexual abusers and CSEM offenders. The treatment manual was conceived to reduce recidivism risk and to contribute to the enhancement of the patients’ personal wellbeing. In this paper, results of the accompanying scientific research are presented: offensesupportive attitudes (N = 23), self-reported CSEM use (N = 10), emotional distress (N = 24), and participants’ subjective risk perception of committing (further) sexual offenses (N = 25) reduced during the course of treatment. A reduction of offense-supportive attitudes was further observed from pre-intervention to 1-year follow-up (N = 8). Changes with regard to selfefficacy, quality of life, participants’ self-perceived ability to control sexual impulses toward children and adolescents permanently, and several measures assessing different kinds of sexual recidivism did not, however, reach any level of significance. During an average observation period of 2.4 years, six patients confessed to have conducted new sexual exploitation material offenses, while no further sexual abuse cases were reported (N = 19). Due to the used research design and small sample sizes, treatment effects cannot be inferred and external validity is limited. This notwithstanding, results provide first evidence for a relationship between treatment participation and self-reported recidivism and psychological well-being.;,citation_author=Tamara S. N.

This study firstly examines the psychometric properties of six assessment measures, which were specifically adapted for the lower functioning offender from existing sexual offender assessments. A group of 211 men who had undertaken HM Prison Service’s Adapted Sex Offender Treatment Programme (ASOTP) were used in this study. The assessments were found to have reasonable psychometric properties as determined by internal consistency and factor analyses. The second part of the study was an exploration of treatment change. Significant pre- to post-treatment change was found on five of the measures. However, the lack of a comparison group makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about treatment change.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Criminal Recidivism after Imprisonment Among Sex Offenders and Violent Offenders: A Comparison between Self-reported and Officially Recorded Reoffending Behavior;,citation_abstract=One of the key issues in criminology is the investigation of criminal recidivism. Reoffence rates are used inter alia to examine the effects of criminal sanctions, to evaluate the effectiveness of reintegration measures, to analyse the development of crime rates, and to map criminal careers. In so doing, the study of reoffending behaviour largely depends on officially recorded criminal sanctions. Thus, the analysis of reoffence rates is, in most cases, restricted to crimes that authorities have become aware of. This paper examines the proportion of officially recorded reoffences and self-reported crimes among a sample of sex offenders and violent offenders who participated in a longitudinal study evaluating the impact of correctional treatment on criminal recidivism. In addition, it is investigated whether the discrepancy between officially recorded and self-reported criminal recidivism is influenced by individual factors such as age, impulsivity, self-esteem, and intelligence. The study is based on a sample of 140 sex and violent offenders for whom officially recorded reoffence data was collected. Data was also collected at follow-up (on average, 1.5 years after prison release) when offenders were asked to complete a self-reported delinquency questionnaire.;,citation_author=Gunda Woessner;,citation_author=Franziska Hefner;,citation_publication_date=2020-06;,citation_cover_date=2020-06;,citation_year=2020;,citation_doi=10.18716/OJS/KRIMOJ/2020.2.10;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Criminology - The Online Journal;,citation_publisher=Criminology - The Online Journal;">

We utilized Implicit Association Tests and self-report questionnaires for emotional congruence with children and analyzed the psychometric properties of these measures. Further, we analyzed the associations between these measures and self-reported pedophilic sexual interests and empathy. The sample consisted of 110 adult community males (prevalence of sexual interest in children at least to some extent: 5.5%) with or without child-related jobs (43.6% vs. 56.4%) recruited online in the general population. Overall, we found equivocal parameters for reliability of the implicit and explicit measures of emotional congruence with children ($\alpha$ = 0.29 to 0.76). The self-reported emotional congruence with children was only weakly linked to the implicit positive evaluations of children ( r  = 0.170, p  = 0.039), not linked to empathy except for distress in social interactions ( r  = 0.199, p  = 0.019), and moderately linked to deviant sexual interests in children ( r  = 0.321 to 0.404, p  $&amp;amp;amp;lt;$ 0.001), especially in men working with children ( R 2  = 0.04, p  = 0.027).

However, this idea is largely based on research in men convicted of sexual offenses and may not generalize to non-incarcerated adults with paraphilic interests. In a sample of 178 adults screened for paraphilic interests in violence or children (from the general Czech population), we hypothesized that childhood sexual abuse and emotional neglect would be associated with offense-supportive cognitions about rape and child molestation. Participants came from a nationally representative sample of Czech adults and were selected if they self-reported high levels of sexual interest in violence and/or children. Participants completed an online survey with self-report measures of sexual orientation, offense-supportive cognitions (Bumby RAPE and MOLEST scales), and childhood sexual abuse and emotional neglect (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire). Controlling for gender, age, and sexual orientation, we found that both rape-supportive cognitions and child molestation-supportive cognitions were significantly associated with higher levels of childhood sexual abuse, but not emotional neglect.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Sexbots as Synthetic Companions: Comparing Attitudes of Official Sex Offenders and Non-Offenders;,citation_abstract=This is the first Italian study to examine views on sexbots of adult male sex offenders and non-offenders, and their perceptions of sexbots as sexual partners, and sexbots as a means to prevent sexual violence. In order to explore these aspects 344 adult males were involved in the study. The study carried out two types of comparisons. 100 male sex offenders were compared with 244 male non-offenders. Also, sex offenders were divided into child molesters and rapists. Preliminary findings suggest that sex offenders were less open than non-offenders to sexbots, showed a lower acceptance of them, and were more likely to dismiss the possibility of having an intimate and sexual relationship with a sexbot. Sex offenders were also less likely than non-offenders to believe that the risk of sexual violence against people could be reduced if a sexbot was used in the treatment of sex offenders. No differences were found between child molesters and rapists. Though no definitive conclusion can be drawn about what role sexbots might play in the prevention and treatment of sex offending, this study emphasizes the importance of both exploring how sexbots are both perceived and understood. Sex offenders in this study showed a high dynamic sexual risk and, paradoxically, despite, or because of, their sexual deviance (e.g. deficits in sexual self-regulation), they were more inclined to see sexbots as just machines and were reluctant to imagine them as social agents, i.e. as intimate or sexual arousal partners. How sex offenders differ in their dynamic risk and criminal careers can inform experts about the mechanisms that take place and can challenge their engagement in treatment and intervention.;,citation_author=Georgia Zara;,citation_author=Sara Veggi;,citation_author=David P.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The Effect of Realistic Appearance of Virtual Characters in Immersive Environments - Does the Character’s Personality Play a Role?;,citation_abstract=Virtual characters that appear almost photo–realistic have been shown to induce negative responses from viewers in traditional media, such as film and video games. This effect, described as the uncanny valley, is the reason why realism is often avoided when the aim is to create an appealing virtual character. In Virtual Reality, there have been few attempts to investigate this phenomenon and the implications of rendering virtual characters with high levels of realism on user enjoyment. In this paper, we conducted a large-scale experiment on over one thousand members of the public in order to gather information on how virtual characters are perceived in interactive virtual reality games. We were particularly interested in whether different render styles (realistic, cartoon, etc.) would directly influence appeal, or if a character’s personality was the most important indicator of appeal. We used a number of perceptual metrics such as subjective ratings, proximity, and attribution bias in order to test our hypothesis. Our main result shows that affinity towards virtual characters is a complex interaction between the character’s appearance and personality, and that realism is in fact a positive choice for virtual characters in virtual reality.;,citation_author=Katja Zibrek;,citation_author=Elena Kokkinara;,citation_author=Rachel Mcdonnell;,citation_publication_date=2018-04;,citation_cover_date=2018-04;,citation_year=2018;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1109/TVCG.2018.2794638;,citation_issn=1077-2626, 1941-0506, 2160-9306;,citation_volume=24;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Deep Learning in the Identification of Electroencephalogram Sources Associated with Sexual Orientation;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;lt;b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Introduction:</i></b> It is unclear if sexual orientation is a biological trait that has neurofunctional footprints. With deep learning, the power to classify biological datasets without an a priori selection of features has increased by magnitudes. The aim of this study was to correctly classify resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) data from males with different sexual orientation using deep learning and to explore techniques to identify the learned distinguishing features. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> Three cohorts (homosexual men, heterosexual men, and a mixed sex cohort), one pretrained network on sex classification, and one newly trained network for sexual orientation classification were used to classify sex. Further, Grad-CAM methodology and source localization were used to identify the spatiotemporal patterns that were used for differentiation by the networks. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Using a pretrained network for classification of males and females, no differences existed between classification of homosexual and heterosexual males. The newly trained network was able, however, to correctly classify the cohorts with a total accuracy of 83%. The retrograde activation using Grad-CAM technology yielded distinctive functional EEG patterns in the Brodmann area 40 and 1 when combined with Fourier analysis and a source localization. <b><i>Discussion:</i></b> This study shows that electrophysiological trait markers of male sexual orientation can be identified using deep learning. These patterns are different from the differentiating signatures of males and females in a resting-state EEG.;,citation_author=Anastasios Ziogas;,citation_author=Andreas Mokros;,citation_author=Wolfram Kawohl;,citation_author=Mateo De Bardeci;,citation_author=Ilyas Olbrich;,citation_author=Benedikt Habermeyer;,citation_author=Elmar Habermeyer;,citation_author=Sebastian Olbrich;,citation_publication_date=2023;,citation_cover_date=2023;,citation_year=2023;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1159/000530931;,citation_issn=0302-282X, 1423-0224;,citation_volume=82;,citation_language=en-US;,citation_journal_title=Neuropsychobiology;">

<p>The WBI @myTabu consists of three isolated sections, one only for participants, one only for the online coaches, and one section for community supervisors (see <a href="#fig-sitemap" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;1</a>). The access to these sections was secured by username and password full-filling the criteria of the DSGVO. On the landing page of the coach section, a dashboard informs the coach on tasks he has to perform (e.g.&nbsp;unanswered messages by a client, open guided tasks). Each coach had only access to the participants he was responsible for. The landing page links to the in-app messenger and a page for working on guided tasks together with the participant. The supervisor section, only accessible by participating community supervisors, provides a landing page which summarized important key aspects (treatment progress, critical events) of all participants, which have been supervised by this supervisor. Due to security reasons, the supervisor was able to see the raw values of the primary endpoint. If a item of the primary endpoint has been graded as a potential hint to recidivism by lawyers within the research team during development of the app, additional judicial information are provided specifically for the federal state the supervision officer is working at.</p>

<p>The participant section, only accessible by participants, provides on the landing page key aspects of their progress, e.g.&nbsp;current saldo, gudied exercises the have to work on, a help page, a first aid kit as well as a section for the WBI. The participants are remembered on open guided tasks or being late with the intervention by in-app alerts. The WBI starts with two introductory sessions, in order to explain the participants how the app works. After finishing the instruction section, the participants is linked to the first lection of the WBI. The structure and organization of the content was identical across both trial arms. The WBI was structured into six modules, each module into four sessions and each session into six to eight lections. A lection was divided into different content blocks: guided exercises, psychoeducation, examples (virtual participants), and automated exercises. Virtual participants accompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor)At the beginning of each session, key elements from the previous session or module were recapped. At the end of each session, the most important points of that session or module were summarized. Content created during exercises was partly dynamic integrated in consecutive sessions. For example, at the start of the intervention participants created a list of positive activities, which was later used to suggest ways in which they could reward themselves for completing a session or module. In both trial arms, the program included digital psycho-educational blocks incorporating multimedia elements such as videos and graphics, as well as guided and unguided exercises. A total of eighteen different online exercises (e.g., fill‑in‑the‑gap tasks, multiple‑choice questions, four-field-tasks) were integrated into the WBI. These exercises were either offered as self‑guided tasks with automated feedback or as coach‑guided tasks in which feedback was provided by online coaches. In the intervention arm, the most relevant aspects of each session were delivered as guided tasks. In the placebo arm, the allocation of tasks as guided or unguided was determined based on a predefined matching procedure to replicate the distribution of guided and unguided tasks in the intervention arm. The feedback of the online coaches was manualized: Within a special section of the WBI, the coach was able to choose pre-build templates for each guided task (see <a href="#fig-act-guided-task" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>). Furthermore, an in-app messaging system allowed the user to communicate with the online coach as well as the supervision officer in a secured environment. It was ensured that messages and feedback for guided tasks has been provided within 36 hours by the coach. In order to enhance the extrinsic motivation of participants, an automatic reward system is integrated based on a gamification approach. That is, participants receive coins and virtual awards for each finished content block. The coins can be changed into Euros, if the participant has collected at least 15 Euros, he can request the payout online. The participant can receive a maximum compensation of 120 Euro. Finally, an online first aid kit was provided for each user and filled with individual skills prepared by the user itself during guided tasks in the intervention arm. In the placebo arm, the first add kit was not individualized but pre-filled with basic hints. Throughout all modules, the speech was friendly, empathetic, simple, and easy to understand (e.g., no technical terms, examples of everyday life) in order to account for the different cognitive functioning level of participants.</p>

The in-person programs have been adapted for online use. Both programs have been designed for CSA as well as CSEM offenders. Parts relevant to the meaningful risk factors of both in-face programs have been digitalized and parts on risk factors not supported by empirical evidence have been skipped in order to shorten the WBI. The content of the intervention arm focused exclusively on psychological meaningful risk factors<span class="citation" data-cites="mannAssessingRiskSexual2010 setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023"><sup><a href="#ref-mannAssessingRiskSexual2010" role="doc-biblioref">4</a>,<a href="#ref-setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>, see <a href="#fig-wbi-overview" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;3</a> for an overview of the theoretical concept of the WBI. To achieve a reduction in re-offenses, it seems to be most promising to target dynamic factors, which are changeable and strong associated with recidivism<span class="citation" data-cites="setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023"><sup><a href="#ref-setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>. Mann et al.&nbsp;(2010) introduced the term meaningful psychological risk factors for sexual offending by identifying those risk factors in the literature, which are dynamic and therefore changeable by treatment and are empirically proved in enhancing the risk for recidivism. Recently, Seto et al.&nbsp;(2023) replicated the findings and proofed the meaningful risk factors with a broader and more recent literature basis. The emprirical basis for risk factors for CSAM-exclusive offences is not as broad as for sexual offending in the sense of in-person offences.<span class="citation" data-cites="babchishinChildSexualExploitation2018"><sup><a href="#ref-babchishinChildSexualExploitation2018" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span> elaborated in their review risk factors for CSEM-exclusive offenders. Atypical sexual interests, sexual pre-occupation, sexual arousal, access to the internet and children, and distorted cognitions are assumed to play a key role in recidivism. Thus, there is a overlap between risk factors for CSA offenses and risk factors for CSAM offenses<span class="citation" data-cites="reichelReviewRiskFactors2024"><sup><a href="#ref-reichelReviewRiskFactors2024" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>. But it is assumed, that e.g.&nbsp;the content of offense-supportive attitudes differs from the content of offense-supportive attitudes for mixed offenders or CSA-exclusive offenders. Access to children or the internet is a so-called facilitating factor in the sense of the Motivation-Facilitation Model of sexual offending and therefore only indirect changeable by treatment<span class="citation" data-cites="setoMotivationFacilitationModelSexual2019"><sup><a href="#ref-setoMotivationFacilitationModelSexual2019" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span>. In consequence, addressed risk factore were the same for participants with CSA offences and participants with CSEM offences. Virtual participants (four male and one female offender with different offense histories) accompanied the participant, narrate about their experiences, and make suggestions from the perspective of someone who is also affected (scored by professional actor). Guided exercises are used at the core of cognitive-behavioral treatment within the WBI. Guided exercises have been developed to train important new concepts online. They ensure, that the participants have to think about the previous contents to answer them correctly, since the online coach reviews the answers. Additionally, guided exercises are the most probable content block in which the online coach gets in touch with the participant (see <a href="#fig-act-guided-task" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a>). All modules within the intervention arm comprised techniques of motivational interviewing<span class="citation" data-cites="rollnickMotivationalInterviewingTreatment2015"><sup><a href="#ref-rollnickMotivationalInterviewingTreatment2015" role="doc-biblioref">9</a></sup></span> to enhance or maintain the motivation of the participants. The WBI is designed for female as well as male participants, but due to a lack of knowledge with regard to specific risk factors for female sex offenders at development of the WBI, the content remains identical for women and men. In order to make the WBI suitable for female participants, the used language was adapted and one female virtual participant has been designed and integrated. The placebo arm was developed to ensure the same mode, dose, and amount of support and attention by supporting online coaches as in the intervention arm - but the content of the modules was unrelated to meaningful dynamic risk factors. The content of the placebo condition comprised information on healthy living, e.g., healthy nutrition, physical activities, or healthy sleep. The amount of guided exercises was the same as in the intervention arm (n = 29 guided exercises), but the exercises have been specifically designed to not induce any sustainable effect. In the following paragraphs, the theoretical backgorund of each module is described in detail.</p>

<p>Theoretical and empirical models of criminal behaviour underscore the relevance of social influences for recidivism.<span class="citation" data-cites="andrewsPsychologyCriminalConduct2010"><sup><a href="#ref-andrewsPsychologyCriminalConduct2010" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span> Negative social environments and resistance to rules and supervision have been identified as meaningful risk factors for sexual reoffending.<span class="citation" data-cites="setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023 hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004"><sup><a href="#ref-setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>,<a href="#ref-hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span> Accordingly, interventions for ICCO under CS should promote the development of protective social networks. Such networks extend beyond family and peers to include therapists, supervision officers, and social workers. The supervision and social relationships module of @myTabu therefore aims to strengthen motivation to establish positive social connections and to reduce resistance to supervision through psychoeducational and cognitive‑behavioural techniques, including the illustration of associations between negative social networks and reoffending and the provision of strategies to disengage from criminogenic influences. A further established risk factor for sexual reoffending is the absence of emotionally intimate adult relationships.<span class="citation" data-cites="setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023"><sup><a href="#ref-setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> Individuals who have committed sexual offences and maintain stable adult partnerships show lower recidivism rates than those who do not, and deficits in emotionally intimate adult relationships are linearly associated with sexual reoffending.<span class="citation" data-cites="hansonAssessingRiskSexual2007 hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a>,<a href="#ref-hansonAssessingRiskSexual2007" role="doc-biblioref">16</a></sup></span> Consequently, this module provides information on these associations and offers guidance to support the development of emotionally intimate adult relationships. To date, the effectiveness of the specific supervision‑related content described here has not been empirically evaluated, either in in‑person or in web‑based interventions.</p>

<p>Lifestyle impulsiveness as a pattern characterised by low self‑control, instability in employment and housing, absence of meaningful daily routines, irresponsible decision‑making, and limited or unrealistic long‑term goals is associated with recdivism. Lifestyle impulsiveness is a well‑established risk factor for sexual reoffending with a broad empirical base.<span class="citation" data-cites="setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023"><sup><a href="#ref-setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> For dysfunctional coping, Knight and Thornton demonstrated that external coping—defined as a tendency to respond to stressful and negatively valenced emotional events in a reckless and impulsive manner—predicts sexual recidivism.<span class="citation" data-cites="knightEvaluatingImprovingRisk2007"><sup><a href="#ref-knightEvaluatingImprovingRisk2007" role="doc-biblioref">17</a></sup></span> To address these risk factors, @myTabu integrates skills training derived from Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT<span class="citation" data-cites="linehanCourseEvolutionDialectical2015"><sup><a href="#ref-linehanCourseEvolutionDialectical2015" role="doc-biblioref">18</a></sup></span>) and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT<span class="citation" data-cites="hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy1999"><sup><a href="#ref-hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy1999" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span>) with the aim of reducing impulsivity and strengthening coping capacities in response to stressful or negatively experienced life events. DBT skills training targets emotion regulation and distress tolerance by teaching alternative behavioural strategies to replace external or sexualised coping. DBT has previously been shown to reduce impulsive behaviour in forensic populations, and web‑based interventions based on DBT principles have demonstrated effectiveness, particularly in reducing stress, across several psychiatric conditions.<span class="citation" data-cites="berzinsDevelopmentImplementationDialectical2004 spijkermanEffectivenessOnlineMindfulnessbased2016 jayawardeneEffectsPreventiveOnline2016"><sup><a href="#ref-berzinsDevelopmentImplementationDialectical2004" role="doc-biblioref">20</a>–<a href="#ref-jayawardeneEffectsPreventiveOnline2016" role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span> ACT focuses on fostering a meaningful life by promoting acceptance of negative internal experiences and providing strategies for adaptive responses to emotional distress.<span class="citation" data-cites="hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy1999"><sup><a href="#ref-hayesAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy1999" role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span> ACT has been successfully applied in offender treatment settings and has shown promising results when delivered via web‑based interventions for various psychiatric disorders.<span class="citation" data-cites="spijkermanEffectivenessOnlineMindfulnessbased2016 jayawardeneEffectsPreventiveOnline2016 lanzaAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy2014"><sup><a href="#ref-spijkermanEffectivenessOnlineMindfulnessbased2016" role="doc-biblioref">21</a>–<a href="#ref-lanzaAcceptanceCommitmentTherapy2014" role="doc-biblioref">23</a></sup></span></p>

RPS involves a systematic and planned application of skills to achieve adaptive solutions. In contrast, ICS is characterised by unsystematic responses, often involving the implementation of the first available option, while AS is marked by avoidance of problems and reliance on external solutions. Empirical evidence indicates that ICCO exhibit higher levels of NPO and lower levels of PPO than the general population and show a greater tendency towards ICS and AS compared with RPS.<span class="citation" data-cites="nezuProblemSolvingTherapyTreatment2013"><sup><a href="#ref-nezuProblemSolvingTherapyTreatment2013" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></sup></span> Moreover, poor problem‑solving skills in this population have been shown to be amenable to change through psychological interventions.<span class="citation" data-cites="wakelingPsychometricValidationSocial2007 mcguireReviewEffectiveInterventions2008"><sup><a href="#ref-wakelingPsychometricValidationSocial2007" role="doc-biblioref">27</a>,<a href="#ref-mcguireReviewEffectiveInterventions2008" role="doc-biblioref">28</a></sup></span> The problem‑solving module therefore aims to improve deficient problem‑solving skills by drawing on the well‑established principles of Problem‑Solving Therapy (PST<span class="citation" data-cites="nezuProblemSolvingTherapyTreatment2013"><sup><a href="#ref-nezuProblemSolvingTherapyTreatment2013" role="doc-biblioref">26</a></sup></span>).

<p>Offense‑supportive attitudes among ICCO can be summarised as beliefs that children are capable of sexually mature relationships, are not harmed by sexual contact with adults, or actively provoke sexual behaviour in adults.<span class="citation" data-cites="mannTreatingCognitiveComponents2016 setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023"><sup><a href="#ref-setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023" role="doc-biblioref">5</a>,<a href="#ref-mannTreatingCognitiveComponents2016" role="doc-biblioref">29</a></sup></span> These attitudes must be clearly distinguished from attempts to excuse or justify one’s own specific offences, which should not be the focus of cognitive treatment.<span class="citation" data-cites="mannAssessingRiskSexual2010"><sup><a href="#ref-mannAssessingRiskSexual2010" role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span> A meta‑analysis by Helmus et al.&nbsp;demonstrated that only offense‑supportive attitudes, as defined above, constitute a psychologically meaningful risk factor in terms of predicting sexual recidivism among ICCO.<span class="citation" data-cites="helmusAttitudesSupportiveSexual2013"><sup><a href="#ref-helmusAttitudesSupportiveSexual2013" role="doc-biblioref">30</a></sup></span> In contrast, offence‑specific justifications have not been shown to be predictive and are therefore not considered primary targets of intervention. The offense‑supportive attitudes module applies cognitive restructuring to modify offense‑supportive beliefs. Cognitive restructuring is the most widely used and best‑evaluated technique for changing maladaptive cognitions in this population. Modifying implicit theories, attitudes, and beliefs is challenging, particularly among ICCO, as such beliefs may not be experienced as harmful by the individual and may instead serve to minimise perceived harm resulting from their own offences.<span class="citation" data-cites="mannTreatingCognitiveComponents2016"><sup><a href="#ref-mannTreatingCognitiveComponents2016" role="doc-biblioref">29</a></sup></span> Nevertheless, several studies have demonstrated that cognitive restructuring can effectively reduce implicit offense‑supportive beliefs and attitudes.<span class="citation" data-cites="beechAssessmentTreatmentDistorted2013"><sup><a href="#ref-beechAssessmentTreatmentDistorted2013" role="doc-biblioref">31</a></sup></span></p>

<p>Individuals who have committed sexual offences have been shown to be more sexually active and more strongly interested in sexual topics than non‑offending individuals.<span class="citation" data-cites="lalumiereTestMateDeprivation1996"><sup><a href="#ref-lalumiereTestMateDeprivation1996" role="doc-biblioref">32</a></sup></span> Sexual preoccupation is characterised by intrusive sexual thoughts and behaviours that are difficult or impossible to control (84) and has been shown to be strongly associated with sexual reoffending.<span class="citation" data-cites="hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004"><sup><a href="#ref-hansonPredictorsSexualRecidivsm2004" role="doc-biblioref">15</a></sup></span> Accordingly, a primary aim of the sexuality module is to provide basic knowledge about sexuality and to support the reduction of excessive sexual thoughts and behaviours. The module further aims to increase awareness of high‑risk situations that may trigger sexual thoughts and behaviours. Participants are provided with strategies to manage and, where possible, reduce sexual preoccupation by limiting sexual thoughts and activities. Emotional congruence with children represents another central risk factor addressed in the sexuality module. ICCO under CS may experience a perceived emotional closeness to children and, when identifying themselves with children, may find it easier to initiate contact with them.<span class="citation" data-cites="matthesDeutscheVersionStable20072008"><sup><a href="#ref-matthesDeutscheVersionStable20072008" role="doc-biblioref">33</a></sup></span> Emotional congruence with children is therefore considered a risk factor strongly associated with sexual reoffending.<span class="citation" data-cites="wardIntegratedTheorySexual2006"><sup><a href="#ref-wardIntegratedTheorySexual2006" role="doc-biblioref">34</a></sup></span> The sexuality module seeks to reduce emotional congruence with children through psychoeducational approaches, emphasising that emotionally equal relationships between adults and children are not possible and providing strategies to establish greater emotional distance from children. Sexual interest in children, including sexual fantasies involving children, constitutes one of the most important risk factors for sexual reoffending among ICCO<span class="citation" data-cites="setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023"><sup><a href="#ref-setoEmpiricallybasedDynamicRisk2023" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> and has been described as a potential motivational factor underlying sexual abuse of children.<span class="citation" data-cites="wardDynamicRiskFactors2016"><sup><a href="#ref-wardDynamicRiskFactors2016" role="doc-biblioref">35</a></sup></span> Reducing sexual interest in children while strengthening non‑deviant sexual interests may therefore contribute to risk reduction. The extent to which sexual interests can change across the lifespan remains debated, and empirical evidence is currently insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.<span class="citation" data-cites="olverEvaluatingChangeMen2020"><sup><a href="#ref-olverEvaluatingChangeMen2020" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></sup></span> Clinically, both changes in sexual interests and highly persistent pedophilic interests have been observed, supporting the conceptualisation of sexual interest in children as a dynamic risk factor that may change over time.<span class="citation" data-cites="olverEvaluatingChangeMen2020"><sup><a href="#ref-olverEvaluatingChangeMen2020" role="doc-biblioref">36</a></sup></span> Within the sexuality module, cognitive‑behavioural techniques are applied to influence sexual interest in and, where possible, sexual fantasies about children, while promoting sexual interest in adults. The techniques employed in this module have demonstrated effectiveness in in‑person treatments and, at least among younger individuals, have also been applied in web‑based interventions.<span class="citation" data-cites="franquefWhichTechniquesAre2015 marshall2011 guseInterventionsUsingNew2012 baileyInternetStudyMen2016"><sup><a href="#ref-franquefWhichTechniquesAre2015" role="doc-biblioref">37</a>–<a href="#ref-baileyInternetStudyMen2016" role="doc-biblioref">40</a></sup></span></p>

<p>The Mood and Risk Questionnaire (MRQ) consists of ten self-developed items, of which six are asking about thoughts and behaviors associated with potential re-offenses and four asking about the psychological and emotional state of the participant. The MRQ was developed by the @myTabu team in order to assess adverse events in a structured manner and with adapted adverse events for individuals who have a history of CSA or CSEM. The MRQ has been assessed before and after each session of the WBI and differs between the items in the pre and post measurements: all items of the pre measurement refer explicitly to the time between finishing last post measurement and before starting the new session (time not working on the WBI). The post measurement explicitly asks for the time during working on the session. The MRQ has the following one-item subscales: (1) Contact planning (“…have you thought about how to best make contact with a child?”); (2) Contact preparation (“…have you made preparations to be able to make contact with a child?”); (3) Urge for CSA (“…have you felt that you must commit a sexual act with a child?”); (4) Urge for CSEM (“…have you felt that you might soon (again) watch child sexual abuse material?”); (5) Sexual tension (“…have you felt that sexual tension has built up within you?)”; (6) Control of sexual thoughts and activity (“…have you felt that it is difficult for you to control your sexual thoughts and activities?”); (7) Unable to cope with the mental burden (“…have you felt that you can no longer endure burdens?”); (8) Suicidal ideations (“…have you thought about taking your own life?”); (9) Mental crisis (“At present, I feel that my behavior and experience are impaired due to mental problems.”); (10) Very bad negative mood (“How do you feel at the moment?”). An adverse event was defined as the highest possible score on each one-item self-report subscale (‘Often’ for subscales 1–8, ‘Strongly agree’ for subscale 9, and ‘Very bad’ for subscale 10). The MRQ post questionnaire explicitly asks for the time during working on the WBI, whereas the MRQ pre questionnaire eclusiviely asks for the last week before measurement timepoint. Please note, that the occurence of a report of the highest possible score was defined as adverse event post-hoc. Due to a mistake by the PI, this questionnaire was not mentioned in the SAP.</p>

<p>The Exclusion Questionnaire (EQ) is a questionnaire to assess the exclusion reasons of the supervision officer. The EQ was specifically developed for this clinical trial by the project team. Only supervision officers were able to exclude a participant from the trial by clicking a button in the WBI. After clicking the button, the supervision officer had to fill in the EQ before the PI was informed to exclude the participant by Email. The EQ asks about eight possible exclusion reasons (e.g.&nbsp;re-offences, withdraw of informed consent) and one additional free text from. Multiple answers on the eight exclusion reasons are possible. Due to a mistake by the PI, this questionnaire was not mentioned in the SAP.</p>

Table&nbsp;5: Mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) for time working on content of one module of the WBI. The time working on content is defined as the sum of the time from creating a data base entry for lection data (at first visit of the lection page) to the time last change of database entry for this lection data occured for each lection the participant worked on in one module. This time difference can be interpreted as a narrow estimator for the time needed to finish the content of a WBI without the time needed for filling in questionnaires, reviews of guided tasks, or waiting times. But it includes the time needed for first answer of a guided exercise and times, in which the participant not logged in or logged in but not worked on the lection.

Table&nbsp;6: Pairwise comparisons for time working on content by module. The time working on content is defined as the sum of the time from creating a data base entry for lection data (at first visit of a lection page) to the time last change of database entry for this lection data occured for each lection the participant worked on in one module. This time difference can be interpreted as a narrow estimator for the time needed to finish the content of a WBI without the time needed for filling in questionnaires, reviews of guided tasks, or waiting times. But it includes the time needed for first answer of a guided exercise and times, in which the participant not logged in or logged in but not worked on the lection.
